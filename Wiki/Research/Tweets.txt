Today the residents of the April 2 neighborhood woke up with news that plunges them into the deepest grief: La Power was murdered . That's what they called the 34-year-old trans young Alejandra Benítez where they saw her grow up and where they witnessed her solidarity and her constant militancy in favor of the trans collective. “He was happy, cheerful. She lived for her brothers and her nephews. He had a very big heart, he helped those who did not have and he collected clothes to donate. He had no evil with anyone, ”her sister Verónica reminds her, reliving the pain of loss. In 1991, when he was just 13 years old, one of his brothers was the victim of a violent crime. 
“What happened has hit me and mobilized me a lot. It has been very strong to wake up with that news. We know her and she is part of our neighborhood. She was very committed to the most vulnerable part of the neighborhood and was always helping with different solidarity issues here. When the floods occurred or when someone needed something, she was there ", says Federico , a neighbor of the 2 de Abril neighborhood where Alejandra was from and where her mother lives whom she had visited yesterday:" She was very close to her mother. She told him she was fine, no one expected this to happen ”. 
Alejandra Benítez was also Alejandra Power or, simply, La Power, as she was known around here. Among the younger trans women, they called her Godmother or Mother because she was the one who accompanied and advised them in the transgender transition process. “ In the neighborhood, the girls called her mom. She was a spokesperson and godmother for the younger trans. She cared for them and protected them. They were very companions of hers and now they are all destroyed, ”says Federico. Alejandra was a sex worker and one of the creators of the group Trans Unidas whose objective is to make visible all the demands and needs of the community of trans women in the province. During the pandemic, Alejandra helped collect merchandise for trans women from Tucumán.
