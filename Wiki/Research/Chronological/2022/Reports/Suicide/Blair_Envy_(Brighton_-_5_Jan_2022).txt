Blair died in her home in Brighton. Her family buried her under her deadname.

In the wake of her passing, local artist Dave Pop! created a mural dedicated to Blair in Steine Street, Brighton, and her community raised funds for [The Clare Project](https://clareproject.org.uk/), a Brighton based charity which supports trans, non-binary and intersex people.
