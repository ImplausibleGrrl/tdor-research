> Thank you for running this page, it's so important. I would like to inform you of the death of a friend of mine, Blair Envy. She took her own life on the 5th of January 2022, but was buried by her family under her deadname, so has not been recorded as a trans death. She died at her house in Brighton, East Sussex, UK. Please let me know if there is any more information needed, I can also provide a photograph for a memorial card if that's an option.
