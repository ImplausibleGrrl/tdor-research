> I lost my 18yo son, my miracle baby, my only child on Earth (other pregnancy was ectopic) to suicide in his dorm on 3/27/22.  I called to check on him every night, and that night we only talked for 10 minutes, from 7:34-7:44 p.m. because I needed to eat supper.  Coroner estimated time of death at 8 p.m., just 16 minutes later.  So much has happened since including my husband going into a rage against a friend of his/coworker of mine for some posts that were hurtful, because my son was transgender and they were making fun of that.
>
> Long story short, my husband is on house arrest and pushing everyone away, including me, but has always had anger issues and have been miserable in our marriage for years, always walking on eggshells.  I have lost my job.  I miss my son so much as he was my entire world.  I am thinking of divorce, but I have had so many tell me not to make decisions while grieving.  Just wondering if anyone else ended their marriage after their son died?
