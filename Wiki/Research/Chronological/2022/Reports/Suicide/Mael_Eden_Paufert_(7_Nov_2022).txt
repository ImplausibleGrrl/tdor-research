> Je viens d'apprendre le décès de Mael, il faisait parti de plusieurs groupes d'entraide et celui-ci en faisait parti... Malheureusement la dépression a prit le dessus... 
> J'espère que tu as trouver la paix, que tu voulais tant avoir. 
> Je fais cette publication parce que ça me touche, la dépression c'est quelque chose de dur à combattre et je me bat contre elle depuis presque 20 ans... Je me sens si triste qu'il n'ai pas réussi à la battre... 
> 
> Repose en paix bonhomme. 


> I just learned of Mael's death, he was part of several self-help groups and this one was one of them... Unfortunately depression took over...
> I hope you found the peace you wanted so much to have.
> I'm doing this post because it touches me, depression is something hard to fight and I've been fighting against it for almost 20 years... I feel so sad that he couldn't beat it ...

> Maël was pure kindness, immeasurably understanding. I will miss him for sure. He was a model for me, as for many others and I could never have thanked him enough for that. Our meetings in Besançon on campus were rich in emotions for me. Thank you Mael, thank you for everything.
> Today I am thinking of your loved ones, and I send them all my support.
