> Her name was Mirza/Julles/Hélène Deneuve... She was among the first to switch to injections in France, translating them to make them accessible to us... She also translated the brochure Baiser des meufs trans, which has helped many of us...
> 
> She was my friend, and today she is no more... They sent me several copies of Baiser des meufs trans, she was the founder of the blog Trans Grrrls, she often talked about our missing sisters... She spoke to me several times about Laura, a friend of hers who had also ended her life... I remember our discussions about drugs, where we thought we could try boh2cb together, or the photos she sent me from time to time, before going out or after her piercings...
> 
> She's also who gave me my codes to create a Riseup account, and who put me in touch with someone holding a mobile zinothèque... She was always there to help, she even told me she would talk to her doctor to find out if he was following people on injections....
> .
> She had also spoken, on self-support, how she had gone on strike at the Post Office while she was trying, and that her colleagues had warned her that she might be fired, but she didn't care, she fought for her ideas, against and against all odds... It was all Mirza, a person in gold, with a heart in solid gold... May she live forever in our hearts, and through all her works that will have paved the way for many of our adelphes.
> 
> Goodbye Mirza.



> It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of Mirza-Hélène Deneuve. Mirza was a trans person, activist and founder of TRANSGRRRLS, on which she published many texts. Mirza was also a talented translator who we were working with on Minnie Bruce Pratt's Il/le [S/He]. Its translation was to be published in 2023 and we are choosing to maintain it. We refuse to let his bright gaze and strength to stand firm together and spread queer pride be forgotten.
> 
> Mirza committed suicide on Tuesday, March 29. Let us never forget: transphobia kills. We send all our support and thoughts to his loved ones, and we will continue his fights in his memory and that of all our missing. May the earth be light to him.





> On March 28, Mirza-Hélène Deneuve killed herself.
> 
> Many tributes have already been written and are circulating on social networks; however, it seems important to us, current or historical members of Transgrrrls, to dedicate a new one to him.
> 
> It was Mirza who created the Transgrrrls blog and the collective of the same name in the summer of 2018. Noting that there were few resources in French at the time about political issues relating to transfemininities, she had the ambition to produce these, whether by translating texts from others or by writing their own. So she set to work over the next two years, and to sign more than half of the blog articles of her various pseudonyms: Sister Mirza-Hélène, Mirza D., Ernest, Mahleneriez, Jules.
> 
> Creator and main contributor to the blog, present in the demonstrations as well as on all the zine stands of the events to which we were invited, Mirza  was  Transgrrrls. With her gone, definitely, it's a blog page that turns.
> 
> Beyond the blog, these are words, ideas, radical energies that continue to cross transfeminist, materialist and transpédégouine circles today. As the vials of liquid estradiol circulate more and more,  Kissing the  Trans Girls  is enthusiastically  shared in squats as well as in family planning centers and LGBTI centres; some protest signs feature Andrea Dworkin. Soon, we will read Minnie Bruce Pratt in French.
> 
> In the meantime, let's read together this poem by Kai Cheng Thom that Mirza had translated in 2020 and which remains sadly relevant:
> 
> you know, fem,
> 
> sometimes I'm so mad at you for being dead,
> 
> I could curse you / I could whine,
> 
> I could write your name on my arms, with fire and blades,
> 
> if it meant you would come back to keep me from hurting myself
> 
> (is it possible that the poetry of self-harm, self-effacement, sacrifice and martyrdom
> 
> is the only language we really shared)
> 
> I know it's selfish / I don't care / did you think of me?
> 
> and to the world of other trans girls that you left in the countryside
> 
> when you joined
> 
> The Eternal Chorus of Sad Trans Girls in Heaven? you piss off,
> 
> I needed you here, your feet in the dust
> 
> with us / I needed your breath, to remember how much / I needed your rage your art your ecstasy your violent wisdom
> 
> I needed your survival to ensure mine,
> 
> I needed a flesh and blood sister, someone who would paint my nails and yell at me
> 
> not a Dead Spiritual Ancestor to poetize /
> 
> fuck poetry, if it doesn't keep us alive,
> 
> fuck art and stories, if
> 
> it's all just an echo chamber reminding us all the time
> 
> that we are going to die,
> 
> I'm tired of the language of mourning
> 
> and I'm tired of being angry,
> 
> it's like all i can do is share these feelings & get likes,
> 
> I can talk and talk and all these words can't save anyone,
> 
> someone/anyone sing me a song of hope and life
> 
> that someone / anyone,
> 
> teaches me the art of resurrection,
> 
> i keep meeting women only after they die,
> 
> like a fairy tale character following a trail made of
> 
> flesh and bone
> 
> someone save me from (your)/our heritage, from this paved road
> 
> glitter and death,
> 
> please someone save me
> 
> like i didn't save you
