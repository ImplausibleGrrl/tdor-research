> 
> Luise Fernandes was transgender and had been living in São Luís for a year, where she was studying psychology at a private university in the capital of Maranhão. After her death, the family ended up burying the body of Devandro Lima, who died in a car accident, in her place.
> 
> 
> The case was only discovered five days after Devandro Lima's family found out about the accident and went to the Legal Medical Institute (IML).
> 
> Luise's family went to court to bury the young woman's body in Brasília, her homeland. But due to negative decisions, she was buried in São Luís.

> 
> Meanwhile, the young woman's body was taken to the Legal Medical Institute. Five days after supposedly burying her daughter, back in Brasília, the mother received a call from the Legal Medical Institute warning that the body she had buried was that of someone else.

> 
> A woman is fighting in court to be able to bury her daughter, who had her body changed at the Legal Medical Institute of São Luís , at the beginning of September this year. With the exchange, the family unknowingly buried the body of another person, while the body that was supposed to be buried was still at the IML.

> The body changed is that of Luise Fernandes Cazé, 23 years old, born in the Federal District, who died 14 days ago in São Luís. A transgender woman, Luise had been living for a year in the capital of Maranhão, where she was a fellow in the Psychology course at a private college in the city.
> 
> “She was very affectionate, very sensitive. She had an empathy with people”, says Luise's mother, Sônia Fernandes Cazé, who lives in the DF, and learned of her daughter's death through social media.
> 
> The victim was found dead, on September 6, in a square, in the Cidade Operária neighborhood, where he lived. According to Sônia, her daughter, who suffered from depression, resorted to suicide, through an overdose of medication.
> 
> Without money, the mother was not able to board immediately for São Luís. The following day, Ms. Sônia went to Instituto Florescer, an organization that supports the LGBTQIA+ public, where Luise had already been treated because of her psychological disorders.
> 
> As it was a holiday, Dona Sônia was only able to pass a power of attorney to the president of the institute, on September 8, so that she could do the reconnaissance and give entry to the release of Luise's body.
> 
> Meanwhile, the young woman's body was taken to the Legal Medical Institute, where another drama would begin for the mother, who was already suffering from having lost her daughter.
> 
> According to Sônia, when the president of Instituto Florescer went to the IML, they reported that “the body was already petrified, it was already rotten. And then she went to recognize this body and called me desperately: 'Dona Sônia, unfortunately the body will not be able to go to Brasília, it will have to be here'.
> To be able to come to São Luís, to say goodbye to her daughter, Dona Sônia needed the help of many people. She only managed to arrive in the capital of Maranhão on September 10th and couldn't even see Luise's body.
> 
> “They didn't allow it and, really, we could already feel the bad smell”, said Ms. Sônia.
> 
> Five days after supposedly burying her daughter, back in Brasília, the mother received a call from the Legal Medical Institute warning that the body she had buried was that of someone else.
> 
> “This news was as if I had received the news that he died there, at that moment again”, lamented the mother.
> The person who Sônia had buried was Devandro Lima Souza, as shown in the document sent to the cemetery, requesting the exhumation of the body to deliver to the family, who live in Santa Inês, in the interior of Maranhão.
> 
> The information we have is that Devandro was the victim of a car accident days before Luise's death. The exchange of bodies was only discovered because his family went to the IML.
> 
> Devandro's body was exhumed on the 16th. Luise's remains in the cold chamber of the Legal Medical Institute.
> 
> According to the lawyer Silas Pazzini, who defends the family, the IML refused to provide a document attesting to the exchange of bodies.
> 
> “The biggest difficulty we have at the moment is documenting. It is necessary that a correction be made in Luise's Death Certificate, to include the new burial place. The real place, because Luise was not buried, another body was buried”, explained the delegate.
> To be able to take the body to Brasília, the family will have to go to court.
> 
> In a note, the Secretary of State for Public Security (SSP-MA), said that there was a mistake in the delivery of the corpse due to the erroneous recognition, by the prosecutor instituted by the victim's family. And that the Legal Medical Institute itself, after verifying the mistake, provided the correction of the act.
> 
> The Human Rights Commission of the Brazilian Bar Association in Maranhão (OAB-MA) is already on the case. For the president, a number of factors contributed to the misidentification.
> 
> “The condition, the smell, the environment, the way it is there is for the person to do that immediately and it is not the right thing to do. The correct thing is that she is in a condition to have at least a few minutes. That you can verify in a humanized way, look at the bodies, look at the characteristics. Sometimes it has a tattoo, sometimes it has a hair feature, a spot, sometimes it has a stain”, highlighted Erik Moraes, president of the OAB-MA Human Rights Commission.
> 
> Dona Sônia just wants to take her daughter to be buried in the city where she was born and rest her heart.
> 
> “I don't want to know who is guilty, I want to solve my problem, take Luise to a dignified burial, that every human being has that right”, declared the young woman's mother.
