suicide


> Tyler took his life in November. His dad just made a Facebook page in his honor.
> 
> If you look at the Facebook page his dad made in his honor, youâ€™ll see it says he was bullied by his mom who did not support his transition. He lived with her part time.


> Tyler was born as Sophia in 2004. He came out in 2018 and stayed Tyler for the rest of his too short life.
> He took his life on November 18, 2022.
> He only had 18 years and 37 days of life.
> 
> This page has been put up in his memory by me, Michael, his Papa.
> 
> His mother [seen in the photos] never accepted Tyler and bullied him to suicide. To me she is an absolute demon for having crushed the life out of such a wonderful, loving, happy person.
