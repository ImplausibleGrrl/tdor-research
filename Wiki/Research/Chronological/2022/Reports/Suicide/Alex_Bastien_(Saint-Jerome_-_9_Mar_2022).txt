suicide


Alex died by suicide after struggling with the effects of a precocious puberty which was changing his body in ways he had expressed he did not want. He had also suffered conflicts and bullying at school.

> “It’s a parent’s worst nightmare.” A mother from Gatineau is crying out from the heart so that no child ever again decides to take their own life because they question their sexual orientation or gender identity.
> 
> On March 9, Annick Dinelle’s life changed. Her child, who had asked to be called Alex, rather than [deadname], committed suicide. Alex’s questions about his gender identity and sexual orientation had begun in the months leading up to his death, his mother claims.
 
> “[He] had asked us if we would accept that she was gay, lesbian or trans. [He] was looking at [himself] a lot. As his parents, he had been told that no matter [how he identified] we were always going to love him”. The child had expressed her wish to wear a [binder] around [his] chest to hide [his] curves and even to have [his] breasts completely removed. For Christmas, he also wanted to receive boxers for boys as a present.
> 
> In the fall, Alex’s parents noticed a change of attitude in their child, who showed more and more aggressive behavior, which was not like him. The mother claims her child was allegedly bullied at school. To help Alex, his parents made an appointment with a doctor, in addition to consulting social workers. Just before spring break, an intervention plan was put in place to support Alex. But that was not enough: the Wednesday following the return to class, Alex ended his life.

A coroner observed that Alex had developed a precocious puberty and was struggling with the changes happening to his body.
