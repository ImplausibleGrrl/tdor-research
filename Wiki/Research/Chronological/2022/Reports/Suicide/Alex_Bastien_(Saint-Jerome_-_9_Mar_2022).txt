Alex died by suicide.


> Organisation: TransEstrie
> 
>> A young kid from Gatineau in  Quebec have died from suicide, they were transgender. Their name was Alex, 10 years old. 
>>
>> Thanks to add them so we can say their name. 



> “It’s a parent’s worst nightmare.” A mother from Gatineau is crying out from the heart so that no child ever again decides to take their own life because they question their sexual orientation or gender identity.
> 
> On March 9, Annick Dinelle’s life changed. Her child, who had asked to be called Alex, rather than [deadname], committed suicide.
> 
> Alex’s questions about his gender identity and sexual orientation had begun in the months leading up to his death, his mother claims.
> 
> “[He] had asked us if we would accept that she was gay, lesbian or trans. [He] was looking at [himself] a lot. As his parents, he had been told that no matter [how he identified] we were always going to love him.”
> 
> The child had expressed her wish to wear a [binder] around [his] chest to hide [his] curves and even to have [his] breasts completely removed. For Christmas, he also wanted to receive boxers for boys as a present.
> 
> In the fall, Alex’s parents noticed a change of attitude in their child, who showed more and more aggressive behavior, which was not like him. The mother claims her child was allegedly bullied at school. To help Alex, his parents made an appointment with a doctor, in addition to consulting social workers. Just before spring break, an intervention plan was put in place to support Alex. But that was not enough: the Wednesday following the return to class, Alex ended his life.
> 
> The school attended by the child and the Sir-Wilfrid-Laurier School Board (CSSWL) did not wish to comment on the file. By email, the CSSWL nevertheless assured “that the school always acts proactively to ensure a positive school climate and a healthy and safe living environment for all students”.
> 
> As a parent, Annick Dinelle would have liked to be better equipped to support her child.
> 
> “We didn’t know what that meant, LGBTQ+. It was AnnSofy who taught us that, confides the mother. We had few resources to know how to manage all that. We welcomed him as we could as parents.
> 
> The case of Alex is “very striking”, but, fortunately, not very common, underlines Laurent Brault, director general of the Fondation Émergence. The organization’s mission is to educate, inform and raise public awareness about the realities of people of diverse sexual and gender identities.
> 
> “Youth is the society of tomorrow,” he insists. From a young age, it is therefore essential to work to deconstruct prejudices and eliminate discrimination on gender identity and sexual orientation, he continues.
> 
> Annick Dinelle, for her part, wishes to send a message to young people who live with the same kind of questions as Alex: “You have the right to be different. Being different doesn’t make you unimportant, don’t keep that inside.”




> Tragic death of Annsofy: “everything was in place” to support the child according to the coroner
> 
> “Everything was in place to properly supervise” Annsofy Bastien, this ten-year-old child who died last March after committing an “impulsive gesture” which turned out to be “impossible to predict”, concludes the coroner responsible for the file.
> Annsofy, who lived mainly with her father in Mirabel, also regularly saw her mother, a resident of Gatineau. The latter, Annick Dinelle, had launched a cry from the heart to improve mental health resources for children after the tragic death of Annsofy
> 
> Coroner Geneviève Richer writes in her investigation report that since the start of the pandemic, the child had exhibited “worrying” behaviors which “suggested a bad life in the process of installation”.
> 
> “Annsofy had developed precocious puberty and was living with difficulty with the changes that were taking place in her body, relates Dr. Richer in her report dated September, of which Le Droit obtained a copy. In addition, she suffered from gender dysphoria and did not wish to be identified with any particular gender, calling herself Alex.
> 
> The child had a follow-up from the Youth Centers, both with his father and his mother. Follow-ups took place every two weeks, sometimes even more frequently.
> 
> The coroner says notes from social workers showed Alex "displayed superior intelligence," but his grades in school "were suboptimal because of his oppositional behaviors and lack of interest."
> 
> Conflicts at school
> Dr. Richard mentions in her report that the child suffered from panic attacks and that she “was often in conflict with her classmates and [that] on the day of her death, she had had a few confrontations with other students at school, then on the school bus on the way home, when she almost got into a fight with a seven-year-old boy". About a month before his death, “Annsofy denied any suicidal ideation” as part of a risk assessment.
> 
> The last meeting with a worker took place on March 3, 2022. Another was scheduled for March 17. On the afternoon of March 9, Alex was scolded by her father for using a laptop computer in her bedroom, despite the rule in place at home “was to use electronic devices in common areas only”.
> 
> Her father then left her alone to think things over. After about 15 minutes, he wanted to see how she was doing. Getting no response, he had to break down the bathroom door where the child was. It was there that he realized that Alex had made a move to take his own life. Himself a first responder, he dialed 911 and began resuscitation maneuvers. The care that was given to him made it possible to stabilize the child. After a stint at the Saint-Jérôme Regional Hospital, Alex was transferred to the Saint-Justine University Hospital Center (CHU). “Her neurological condition remained precarious throughout her hospital stay and deteriorated until she was declared brain dead on March 11, 2022 at 12 p.m. by the intensive care doctor at the CHU. Saint-Justine,” says the coroner.
> 
> “The parents were both present and motivated to [support] their daughter, while the school environment made the necessary efforts to offer individual and close psychosocial support. His impulsive gesture will have been, alas, impossible to predict, despite the follow-ups to which Annsofy willingly submitted. »
> — Genevieve Richer, coroner
> "Alas"
> The coroner, who finds a suicide, did not make a recommendation in her report. “It therefore seems that everything was in place to properly supervise Annsofy, during this difficult period when she was experiencing a certain degree of psychological distress, writes Dr. Richer. The parents were both present and motivated to [support] their daughter, while the school environment made the necessary efforts to offer individual and close psychosocial support. His impulsive gesture will have been, alas, impossible to predict, despite the follow-ups to which Annsofy willingly submitted.
