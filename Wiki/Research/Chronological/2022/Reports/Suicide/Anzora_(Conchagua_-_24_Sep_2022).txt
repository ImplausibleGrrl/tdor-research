> Transgender woman "took her own life due to discrimination and lack of support from her family" , as confirmed by the LGBT+ Collective association "Pearls of the Orient" . The report of her death from her remains low profile, however, some of her acquaintances from her referred to her by her last name from her, Anzora; but she was known as "Chocolatito" , and she lived in the municipality of Conchagua, in La Unión.
> 
> Anzora, like other gender-diverse people, has been the victim of harassment and intolerance in the country. A similar case occurred in the municipality of Ahuachapán, on June 18, 2021. The Anzora case, however, did not finalize details about his death. However, Anzora's death would accumulate among the unofficial statistics that LGBT organizations list, since the 1990s.
> 
> Until July of this year, the organization Communicating and Training Trans Women (Comcavis Trans), has reported, in short, one murder of a trans woman, without gender expression. And, at least in the homicide record, the years 2020 and 2021 reported a 50% contraction compared to the 2018 record (16 homicides).

> Chocolate
> Anzora was a transgender woman, known to correlatives and organized activists, in LGBT institutions. Yesterday afternoon, the lawyer and activist Karla Guevara from the Alejandría Collective, expressed her “anger and rejection” of her, among other things, for her material loss from her. "She took her own life yesterday, a victim of the rejection of her family and society in general ," she detailed, referring to information acquired by the institution that the victim represented, Colectivo LGTBIQ Estrellas del La Union Gulf.
> 
> “ The first thing the mother asks is that they cut her hair and dress her in men's clothing, (depending on why she gave birth to a man) outrageous, reprehensible. May you find eternal rest, sister!” , Guevara added, he added, from the information cited. He also valued, in response to a revictimizing society, that "the worst thing is that they don't even respect our identity when they are dead..." .
> 
> Social organizations such as the Perlas de Oriente Collective lamented the loss of Chocolatito. From their official virtual sites, they expressed their “deepest condolences for the death of our colleague Trans De Conchagua La Unión, member of the LGTBIQ Collective Estrellas del Golfo La Unión” . And they exclaimed “God receive you in Glory Sister of him. How sad . "

> LGBT population mourns the death of 4 trans women in the last week
> gender identity
> Anzora was discriminated against because of her gender identity and expression, according to the activists. Situations like these have been recurrent in the country, and have left more than 700 LGBT people murdered since the 1990s, according to reports from the Solidarity Association to Promote Human Development (Aspidh Arcoíris Trans), in response to discrimination, living conditions, and access to social benefits have pushed the victims, according to an extensive literature of the groups, to conditions such as those of informal work, or sex work.

> Trans people will be able to change their name, orders the Constitutional Chamber
> International organizations, such as Human Right Watch (HRW), have reiterated their demand for the approval of a Gender Identity Law, which guarantees non-discrimination in employment and economic opportunities for transgender and transsexual women and men in the country. The demand is still valid for dozens of social organizations that make up the Permanent Table for a Gender Identity Law in El Salvador, and the proposal in the Legislative Assembly has been vigorous for more than 14 years.
> 
> “ I know that fighting the system is tiring and it's a fight like David facing Goliath, but David still beat him. Make fun of them, keep limiting the rights of TRANS people, but I'm going to give them a fight. Know it! I will give you more details soon” , said Guevara, referring to the social demands of the LGBT population.
> 
> Karla Guevara: First trans woman to change her name and gender
> Karla Guevara, in fact, is the first woman to obtain a resolution in favor of a reassignment in the name and gender registers, in her identity documents. The case follows that of police officer Aldo Alexánder Peña, and both cases were resolved by the First Family Court of San Salvador, by virtue of her gender identity and expression.
> 
> However, both Guevara and his team of lawyers from the Foundation of Studies for the Application of Law (Fespad), have expressed their disagreements, as they do not have a Gender Identity Law, which conditions the parameters to establish said changes. Among other demands, the Constitutional Chamber has ordered to satisfy the identity demand, considering that the name not in accordance with gender identity and expression is unconstitutional and "harmful to human dignity" , demanding from the Legislative Assembly adjustments in the Law of the Name and Natural Person (LNPN).

> LGBT: For 5 homicides, accused will serve up to 66 years in prison
> LGBT deaths
> Anzora would have lost his life, after a suicide, according to activist organizations. Before her report, the Cmcavis Trans activist, Gracia Villalobos, reported a homicide against a trans woman, in "the eastern part of the country . " Although the activist did not finalize more details about the events, the case would be part of the 644 homicides reported by organizations such as the ASPIDH, during the years 1992 to 2022; and, in turn, it would be one among the 411 total homicides reported by the PNC, until last July 17.
> 
> However, "as of the Exception Regime, the average number of daily homicides has decreased ," as confirmed by the head of the Ministry of National Defense, Francis Merino Monroy. This trend occurs after the report of the 87 homicides perpetrated between March 25 and 27, a month that accumulated 172 violent acts until its end. From then on, the months of April (23), May (16) and June (28) reported lower statistics, even compared to January (75) and February (67).
> 
> The decreasing trend would be similar, when compared to homicides against LGBT people. So, of the 3,942 homicides reported by the PNC, at least 26 would be of LGBT+ people, for the year 2017. In 2018, the reports were 3,340 homicides, of which 16 would be of sex-diverse people. In 2019, the general homicide records were 2,398, of which at least 10 would respond to the LGBT+ population.
> 
> LGBT: 1 trans death, and arrests continue
> In 2020, likewise, the Police Corporation would report some 1,341 homicides, of which at least 8 LGBT people appeared in the registry. By 2021, the number of homicides has contracted to 1,140; and, as in the previous year, at least 8 LGBT+ people were the victims. While, of the 411 fatalities reported for 2022, one would be identified as an LGBT person, according to Greece's statements.





> I feel anger and repudiation of this patriarchal system, which continues to take more trans women from us; Chocolatito (como was known) took her own life yesterday, a victim of rejection by her family and society in general. But don't even bite, they respect our identity...
