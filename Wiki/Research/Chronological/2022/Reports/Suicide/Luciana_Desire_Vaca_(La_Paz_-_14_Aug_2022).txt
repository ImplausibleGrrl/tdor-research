> Violence, intolerance, discrimination and impunity put an end to it. Luciana Desiré, 34, won the crown of Miss La Paz Trans in 2017 and Miss World Bolivia Trans in 2019. She had a "busy" agenda until August of this year when her ex-lover Dan AR changed her life of her He stabbed her eight times while she was sleeping. The damage was irreversible and she was left in a wheelchair.

Diana Málaga, president of the La Paz Organization of Transvestites, Transgenders and Transsexuals (OTRAF), said that her partner felt “oppressed” and a “burden” for those around her. Her rhythm of life had changed quite a bit; her de ella from participating in various activities to remaining in a wheelchair and depending on others.
> 
> “Luciana has been miss trans from La Paz and Bolivia. She felt cramped and oppressed able by the activity that she had. She was a person who was not still and became dazed. They did not find her de ella attacker and she feared that he would come back to look for her to finish what he had started. In addition to all that, there are bad people who wrote to her telling her that she deserved what she was going through, that practically this was a punishment that God had given her. It was not easy at all,” she noted. 
> 
> After the violent attack, Vaca Juárez moved from La Paz to Cochabamba, where he was living with one of his brothers. On Thursday, October 20, she arrived in the wonderful city because she had to pick up her disability card, but she was found dead the day she planned to return to Llajta. She took her own life from her.
> 
> BROKEN DREAMS
> 
> Luciana Desiré was born in Santa Cruz, but lived for many years in La Paz. She grew up in a "conservative" family and that situation prompted her to leave her home and work for her dreams. She wanted to be a woman since she could remember and she achieved it, although it took her six years to get the "acceptance" of her loved ones. As soon as Law 807 on Gender Identity came into force, she presented her documents and managed to be the third person to change her name.
> 
> The young woman found a family in the LGTBI community. She held the position of member of the Citizen Council for Sexual and Gender Diversities of La Paz. Since her activism, she has been fighting against injustices.
> 
> Violence knocked on his door. In August of this year, Luciana Desiré denounced her crush. She said that Dan AR attacked her in a surprise way, while she was sleeping. The eight stab wounds to her chest and back damaged her spinal cord and she lost the mobility of her legs. 
> 
> On that occasion, the trans woman said that there was no discussion prior to the violent act. She didn't understand her boyfriend's attack. “I was lying down, almost sleeping. It happened at a time when I couldn't defend myself. He had everything planned because he made an attempt on my life when I was sleepy (…). They do not know what I have suffered. I have seen death pass through my eyes. He has seen that he has hurt my spine and that I could not walk and has bothered to sit in a chair and look at me telling me that he wanted to see me die, that he wanted to give himself the pleasure of seeing me die (…)”.
> 
> THE CALL
> 
> Dan AR went on the run. After a few days, he was encouraged to call Luciana Desiré supposedly to apologize. “Forgiveness is not going to give me back my walk. I am not going to walk again, you do not know what I have suffered (…). I did not harm anyone, I just wanted to have a normal life, I do not know why these acts of hatred occur in our community, ”she asked the young woman about two months ago, while she asked for justice. 
> 
> THE FUFUGE
> 
> Luciana's lover had not "come out of the closet". Her family found out that he had a romantic relationship with a trans woman and closed the doors on him. The now fugitive, 33 years old, blamed his girlfriend for the rejection of her relatives. 
> 
> Instead, Luciana was pleased with herself. She loved the new image of her; a young woman with long, shapely legs. She underwent a few surgeries to complete her transformation, including touch-ups to her nose, chin, cheekbones, and breast implants.
> 
> His life took an unexpected turn more than two months ago. She left a hospital in a wheelchair. She felt that her modeling career was over. She stopped dreaming and was going through a depressive picture. 
> 
> For her friends, her boyfriend "killed her in life". They point him out as responsible for the death of Luciana Desiré.
> 
> BEHIND THE AUTHOR
> 
> From the Prosecutor's Office, they made it known that at least five raids were carried out, some in Oruro, with the intention of capturing Dan AR The Public Ministry has an open case against Luciana Desiré's ex-lover for attempted femicide, a crime that is punishable by 20 years of imprisonment. 
> 
> Criminal investigation personnel continue to work to find the whereabouts of the defendant, the national director of the Special Force to Fight Violence (FELCV), Rubén Darío Lobatón, said in recent days.
> 
> It is expected that in the next few days it will be confirmed whether the accused has left the country. If this information is verified, the Prosecutor's Office will request an extradition so that the author can be brought to justice. 
> 
> THE STRUGGLE
> 
> The reality of Luciana Desiré is shared by thousands of transgender people. Although all forms of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity are prohibited in Bolivia and some regulations have been issued in favor of the LGBTIQ+ population, there is still a long way to go to be an inclusive, tolerant and respectful country of human rights. 
> 
> The Ombudsman's Office registered, between 2021 and 2022 (until almost the first semester), 77 complaints from people with diverse orientation and gender identity for the violation of their rights; the majority corresponds to the departments of La Paz and Santa Cruz with 20 cases, respectively. Cochabamba ranks third with 11 demands. 
> 
> The most denounced rights are those related to the guarantees of due process and access to justice (with 21 processes) and the right to equality and non-discrimination (18 cases). 
> 
> According to the groups, more than 65 “hate crimes” with death have been registered in the last 10 years in Bolivia. Only two have sentences for the murder of transgender women; the cases of Dayana Kenia Zárate in Santa Cruz and Litzy Hurtado in El Alto, La Paz. 
> 
> There is no official information on “hate crimes”. The movements have been collecting data over the years through press releases, reports and complaints to the groups because the Bolivian Penal Code does not recognize the "hate crime based on sexual orientation and gender identity." These cases are typified as murder or manslaughter, depending on the circumstances in which the death occurred.
