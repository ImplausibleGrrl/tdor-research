> I would like ask if it would be possible to add to someone not listed.
> Rose, a 15 years old that died of suicide because of transphobia and bullying suffered in school, on the 25th of January 2022, in the city of Vila Real, Portugal. 
> 
> There's a lack of information regarding Rose but from friends reports they were Trans and had the intent to change they legal name to Rose. 



> A 15-year-old trans girl and student at Escola SecundÃ¡ria Camilo Castelo Branco, in Vila Real, allegedly asked to go to the bathroom during a class.
> 
> Rose later appeared dead in a valley in the city of Vila Real this Tuesday.
>
> Reports on social networks indicate that Rose, who still could not have changed her citizenship card, would not feel fully understood and accepted within the family due to her gender identity and would be the target of bullying in the school environment.
>
> Several reports in groups on social networks rise up against the transphobic comments that she is being targeted, even after her death.
>
> A publication that is being shared on the social networks of LGBTI+ people asks:
>
> "It is not fair that we continue to see kids full of trauma from bullying that they suffer daily in the school context!
>
> The gender difference should not be an obstacle to living, someone's sexual orientation should not continue to be a nuisance for someone who is not in the body of someone who is homosexual, bisexual or whatever!
>
> How long will these themes not be addressed in schools? Trying to soften the situation since they were little so they don't become vile and cruel adults!" 
> 
> It should be recalled that a study by the Francisco Manuel dos Santos Foundation, published last November, reported that 23% of young people have had suicidal thoughts or acts and that 26% take or have taken antidepressants.



> Rose. A 15-year-old transsexual girl, student at Camilo Castelo Branco Secondary School (Vila Real, Portugal).
>
> Rose was found dead in a valley in the city of Vila Real, last Tuesday (01/25/2022).
>
> This girl was unable to change her name on her citizen card because she was not accepted by her family. The same girl who was bullied daily at school.
>
> With this I want to say and draw attention to the fact that transphobia and bullying KILL.
