> Hello, 
> 
> My name is [redacted] My wife and partner Nikki O'brien (born Nicholas O'brien) recently took her own life. She had recently come out to me,her mother, her sister, and the last day of her life;her father. The same day she took her own life, she received some hateful texts that her father after coming out to him. There were many other factors involved...hateful comments that were yelled at her from cars driving by; lack of proper guidance and support for her transition...in general: the way people treated her after she came out...
> 
> Nikki was very shy and insecure. She had trouble meeting people and making friends. Other than myself and her sister: she didn't have anyone to talk to about her feelings. Before she had a chance to bring her light to the world: she died. I don't want her life, beauty and struggle to be for nothing, or forgotten. Her death was a suicide: but many people who just couldn't accept her for HER, the hateful comments that people made to her are what provoked her to end her life. I would like to know if you could please send me some resources or ideas on how I can best honor her life and memory.
