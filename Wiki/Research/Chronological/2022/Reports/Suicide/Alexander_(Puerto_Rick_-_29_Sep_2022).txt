> Last night we lost another brother from Puerto Rico. There has been so much cyber bullying and emotional harassment that Alexander didn't make it. He was an amazing support to the Trans M Community in Out 100X35 little Island and served as a moderator in many activities geared towards visibility to become a better man than the traditional man role. He also had a trouble side one that constantly overshadowed all the goodness he spread. My heart is broken because we lost another so young Trans M. He was selected to be part my project from the very beginning.

> He will be missed and always remembered...hasta Pronto Alexander.
