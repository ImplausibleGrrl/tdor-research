suicide



> WICHITA, Kan. (KWCH) - Wichita is mourning the death of Rexy Que, a member of the LGBTQ community who died by suicide earlier this month, which also happens to be Pride Month.
> 
> Pastor Jackie Carter of Wichita’s Table of Hope Church said being who you are can be difficult in today’s world.
> 
> “Our trans folk are 14 percent more likely to have suicidal ideation than anyone else, anyone who identifies by the alphabet are 4-5% more likely, throw youth in there and it increases,” Carter said.
> 
> And suicide is a significant problem.
> 
> “We can cut those numbers in half by simply addressing people by the pronouns they want. That’s all we have to do. We don’t have to understand it, we don’t have to accept it, we just have to address people the way they want to be addressed,” Carter said.
> 
> The pastor said Que was a change agent smart, intelligent and loving. The “why” still stands when it comes to their death.
> 
> “If we had those answers, every time someone committed suicide, it would be so much easier for friends and family,” Carter said.
> 
> Carter said Que’s death is a huge loss as they were a fierce advocate in the community. She said Que was also a great musician, and honest.
> 
> And while Carter said desired answers may never come, there needs to be more mental health resources, saying though now gone, Que left something priceless to others.
> 
> “And you helped me become who I am, and Rexy did that for more people,” Carter said.
> 
> A celebration of life for Rexy Que is set for 1 p.m. June 18 at Table of Hope Church.

> Over the weekend someone very close to me took their own life. They were a best friend, former roommate and partner of 4 years, and a loved member of my chosen family.
> .
> This loss is devastating. Not only to friends and family, but to the local community as well. They were one of the most intelligent people I have ever known, and they were a fierce advocate. From WSU’s Spectrum, to Equality Kansas, and WiTCoN. They dedicated their life to helping LGBTQ people find their way, and they were a common face to see at many events. I’ll never forget standing with them at rallies, face to face against people who wished nothing but harm on us. I’ll never forget how strongly they worked for change. They brought so much good into the lives of many who really needed it, and the work they did will help ensure that many more will see some of that good too. They quite literally saved my life, and I know I’m not the only one. I wish everyone could know them the way that I have.
> .
> As strong as they were, the battles they fought were difficult ones. Nightmarish, even. The world had not been kind to them, regardless of the good they brought into it. I am not a very spiritual person, but I do so very much wish they have peace now, and I hope they have known how deeply and sincerely I have loved them.
> .
> It’s with great and terrible pain that I am forced to say;
> .
> Good bye, Rexy Que.



> We are deeply saddened to learn about the passing of MBLGTACC 2019 Conference Chair Rexy Que.
> Rexy was passionate about using data analysis to shift public policy. They were a performer, musician, advocate and strong force in the state of Kansas pushing for necessary change. Friends and colleagues of Rexy speak of their impact on their lives in educational, organizing and social spaces. They were an eager leader and familiar face at TransKansas, the South Central Chapter of Equality Kansas and Wichita State University.
> It is always a disheartening day to lose trans and nonbinary kin. In our current moment when we are witnessing extreme opposition to trans and nonbinary existence it is important to take care of each other the best we can. Our love and positive energy goes out to all those touched by Rexy's impact, the Kansas communities experience the ripple of this loss, and anyone who Rexy called family and friend. Rest in peace and power Rexy.

> I have to say I'm completely gutted to hear the news about my friend and former colleague Rexy Que. We worked together at Trust Women where Rexy knocked hundreds and hundreds of doors advocating for abortion access in Kansas.
