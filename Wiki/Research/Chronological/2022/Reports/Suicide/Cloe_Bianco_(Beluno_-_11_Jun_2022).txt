> (ANSA) - ROME, JUN 14 - A 50-year-old transgender former teacher burned herself alive in her camper van on a northern Italian road at the weekend. Cloe Bianco, former teacher at the Istituto Mattei high school of San Donà di Piave near Venice, had said she was going to commit suicide in a blog post on Friday.
>
> Her charred body was found in the burned-out vehicle on the regional highway between Auronzo and Misurina near Belluno north of Venice on Saturday.
>
> In her blog post last Friday Bianco said: "Immediately after the publication of this communiqué I will carry out my auto da fe, or rather my free death.
>
> "On this last day I have celebrated with a tasty meal and excellent nectars from Bacchus, enjoying for the last time wine and food I like.
>
> "This simple party of the end of my life was accompanied by good music in my little home on wheels, where I will now remain.
>
> "This is the most poetic way to live my life to the best and end it in the same style.
>
> "Here everything ends". (ANSA).


> Cloe Bianco was a transsexual italian woman and teacher, who was suspended for three days when she decided to come out and was then permanently removed from teaching.
> 
> Cloe killed herself by setting her camper on fire and, before doing so, she announced it in a post on her blog dedicated to transgender people. In the same post she attaches a copy of the living will and the holographic one, documents which he explains that he left next to his body along with the book she had written about her experience and the decision to become Cloe.
> 
> She was 58 years old.
