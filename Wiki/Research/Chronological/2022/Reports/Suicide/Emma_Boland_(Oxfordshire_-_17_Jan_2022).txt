[Her funeral was in Bampton. No public reports found. Hold for now]


> Today I attended the funeral of local 15year old young trans woman, Emma Boland who took her own life last month.
> 
> In the small Anglican Church, packed to bursting with her family and friends, school mates and local community, tears flowed freely and overwhelming love, shock and grief filled the air.
> 
> We will never know why Emma took her own life. What we do know as transgender and non-binary is that gender dysphoria and dysmorphia can be a crushing weight to bear alone. Many get overwhelmed or are not believed, told they shouldn’t be that way.
> 
> Emma had devoted parents and leaves behind a brother. Their brother couldn’t face the funeral. 
> 
> It was as tough a funeral as I’ve ever attended. Even the Vicar was broken by the ordeal and it was visible, tangible.
