> With sorrow we lost today Gael, a young and resilient trans man who committed suicide in MacapÃ¡.
>
> Transphobia makes one more victim in the full month of trans visibility, so, unfortunately Gael joins so many other trans people who fail to meet the tragic 35-year life expectancy.
>
> He was strong, faced a transformative society and still became a symbol of resilience and inspiration to those who knew him.
>
> He will never be forgotten, his power will echo as an inspiration to many.
>
> Gael presente!

That's what I'm talking about, take good care of those who suffer from anxiety or depression. Every minute of a suicide. When someone says that they are in an anxiety crisis, take good care of that person. Try to stay close to them. I do my best to make them happy again. Anxiety is not fresh and it is not a joke. Tell these people that you love very much to disassemble all your care for her just don't leave it alone then just come here to say that there is another nice person good people who went for anxiety or depression ðŸ˜”
Rest in peace my friend Gael Pandinho ðŸ’”
