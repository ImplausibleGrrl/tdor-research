> Hi. I have a friend who passed away (Morgan Dee, she/her, legal name Emily Kwolek) by taking her own life. She was trans and anxiety about society contributed to her loss and I want to have her remembered. I have pictures and can point to the coroner's office and I think other friends might want to contribute personal thoughts. 
>  
> How do we go about this? Sorry but I am just not sure how to proceed.
