accident at work


> On July 27th, my best friend/platonic life partner, Lilith (Kenny) Russell was in a work accident and passed away. We are all heartbroken by this loss and devastated for their/his children, Ciara and Jacob.
> 
> I will forever miss you, Lili, and I promise I will do everything to take care of our little family. We're gonna do what we can to make sure you are respected and remembered properly. As pissed as I am, I'm thankful that BPD and Bipolar 1 didn't win. Since you could never catch up on sleep babe, I'm glad you can now.
> 
> Friends, I'm unsure was is needed at this time, but i would be grateful for the help sending positive energy or prayers their way. And thank you to everyone who has already offered to help and bring food.
> 
> As I get more information about the next steps the family is taking, I will update. Thank you.
