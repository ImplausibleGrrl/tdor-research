> PERRY COUNTY, Pa. (WHTM) – A fatal crash on US-11 near Duncannon, Perry County closed both southbound lanes on US-11 early Monday evening. A man, who has been identified by the Perry County Coroner as Earvin Otero, 26, died from multiple severe traumatic injuries.
> 
> The coroner believes the [woman] died in the single-car accident on either Monday, March 21, or Tuesday, March 22 after his vehicle went off the road and into a ravine at Exit US 22/US 322 East – Harrisburg near the Dauphin/Perry county line.

> Police say Otero was driving a 2016 Nissan Rogue at a high rate of speed before losing control at a curve in the road. Otero then struck an embankment, went airborne, and then struck a tree before coming to a rest in a wooded ravine 20 feet below the road. Otero was found dead in the driver’s seat. Police say he was not wearing his seatbelt but airbags were deployed.



> Africa Otero, 26, has not been heard from since 1 AM Sunday, March 20, when she posted a short video on YouTube from inside the Mamajuana club, on the first block of North 9th Street in Lebanon, Pennsylvania. She did return home and her family is very worried.
> 
> She wanted to go to her house to change her clothes before meeting an unidentified man in Milton for the first time.
> 
> Africa always answered their phone and was supposed to pick up a friend Sunday who was coming into town from New Jersey, but he never arrived to meet them. Her phone is going straight to voicemail and she never showed up to meet her friend.
> 
> Africa’s car is also missing,a silver 2016 Nissan Rogue, with Pennsylvania registration LKL-4831.
> 
> Anyone who has information about Africa or sees her car should call Harrisburg police at 717-558-6900, or the Otero family at 717-797-7362
> 
> Africa was born and raised in San Juan, Puerto Rico. About six years ago, she relocated to Harrisburg. Her sibling did an interview with PennLive, updating the previous missing persons story. They do describe Africa’s gender identity both in terms of her vulnerability and her transition – the article has some misgendering and deadnaming, but is rather robust with updated details.
> 
> Joseph Vazquez has been working with law enforcement authorities from various counties, and including New Jersey, to trace his younger sibling’s steps on Saturday.
> 
> Vazquez used Africa’s iPad to track their text messages.
> 
> One stream involved a person Africa was supposed to meet in Camden County, N.J. Vazquez tracked the location to a Motel 6 in Brooklawn. Africa texted to someone “Are you here,” Vazquez said. But there was no answer.
> 
> “That’s when everything gets weird and dark,” he said.
