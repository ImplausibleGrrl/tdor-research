> Leyah Suan was taken away from us in 2022. TW: Death. Leyah was hit by a car and she was homeless. This hit hard for me because this is on my turf. The homeless cannot continue to be treated like ??. Leyah loved makeup and purses. This makes over 60+ lives were lost in 2022.



> Leyah was very proud of her trans identity, said Shannon Dominguez-Stevens of Maryhouse. "Leyah was a very regular guest at Maryhouse. She was known and loved by the whole team for her eccentricities and near constant words of affirmation, sprinkled with some salt. Leyah was not widely accepted or welcomed into social circles but at Maryhouse she found a safe space to express her various glimmering identities and we are all so honored to have served her in her time earthside. I remember clearly the day we received the call that Leyah had succumbed to injures, we were told by the CHP officer that she had us listed as an emergency contact -- what a bittersweet reality. She is so greatly missed, her picture remains on our front counter -- a reminder of her beautiful life."
