They said she spoke to her roommate for just under a minute at 10:14 p.m. to say that she was waiting for the bus at a transfer station, probably somewhere near Minute Maid Park, and was headed home, which was in a neighborhood north of the stadium.

When they call her cell phone, which does not have a tracker function, it goes straight to voicemail, they said. Friends also said that while Princess did use some dating apps, she was not seeing anyone at the moment, and that she had been verbally harassed on the street in the past. They said she rarely went out in public without a mask.

> I’m writing this post to pull together some various fragments of the story. When I saw “Houston” – my mind immediately went to Monica Roberts, founder of TransGriot blog. Monica was from Houston. So I pulled this together to share and hope that all of Monica’s friends, fans, and followers will share it widely in the Houston area. Call the Astros and the stadium and ask how they are helping to find their missing employee. Call the media.
