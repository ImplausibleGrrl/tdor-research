> Loved Ones Seek Answers as Miami-Dade Police Investigate Transgender Woman's Murder
> By Jamie Guirola • Published May 16, 2022 • Updated 3 hours ago
>   
> 
> Miami Dade Police is very tight-lipped about the murder of a transgender woman that happened Saturday and has yet to release details about the case.
> 
> Her body was found in a pool of blood at the intersection of NW 32nd Avenue and NW 132nd Terrace in Opa-locka.
> 
> While waiting for information and answers, more than 100 people stood at the intersection to remember 50-year-old Nedra Sequence Morris. Those who knew her well called her Sequence.
> 
> 
> 
> Police are looking for more answers into the death of a transgender woman, whose body was discovered over the weekend in Opa-locka. NBC 6's Claudia DoCampo reports
> “We pray, that God speaks to us, we don’t go out with a vengeance, that we know justice will be served," said a cousin to the crowd.
> 
> The vigil was held at the same spot Sequence’s body was found. Her family says the body was dumped there from a moving vehicle after she was shot in the head at an unknown location Saturday morning.
> 
> “From what I got from this, it was a cruel, cruel, nasty calculating thing to do," said Juanita, Sequence’s aunt.
> 
> Miami-Dade Police is investigating and have not confirmed the case details.
> 
> “I want to say whoever did this…you hurt the whole LGBTQ community,” said a relative.
> 
> Sequence was a transgender woman. Her aunt hopes the murder wasn't a hate crime.
> 
> “I pray to God nobody was that ignorant this time and day…she has had some negative aspects from being that,” said Juanita.
> 
> Last year, the Human Rights Campaign tracked a record number of violent fatal incidents against transgender people. Especially Black transgender women.
> 
> Tatiana Williams, a friend of Sequence, is an advocate and founder of Trans Inclusive. She hopes this vigil and the community keep pressure on the police to catch the killer.
> 
> “When these deaths happen and people that are working in the PD or in the community, they don't know how to advocate for us, so a lot of times these cases go cold," said Williams.
> 
> Police are looking for a 2017 Jaguar F-PACE that left the scene
> 
> Anyone with any information is asked to call Miami Dade Crime Stoppers at 305-471-TIPS. Tipsters can remain anonymous.
