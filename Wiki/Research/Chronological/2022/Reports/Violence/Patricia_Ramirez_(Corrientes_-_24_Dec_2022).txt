> The trans woman who was found on Saturday morning with serious injuries and who until noon yesterday remained in intensive care at the Hospital Escuela de la Corrientes died yesterday. Patricia Ramírez, 41, was wanted since Friday night by her friends and family and on Saturday she was found in the 17 de Agosto neighborhood of the city of Corrientes, with multiple injuries resulting from an alleged crash.
> 
> “The loss is irreparable. Patricia was a militant for trans rights and the job quota, she was a comparsera, a very educated girl, a partner and a Peronist. She was essential, ”said Teresita Paz, a Corrientes militant and friend of Patricia, in dialogue with the DIARIO de la Región .
> 
> Paz, like different organizations and movements of the diverse community, held the State responsible for the death of Ramírez, who did not have a stable job in a province that still does not adhere to the national labor quota law for transvestites, transsexuals and transgender. “ She was ultra-qualified to occupy any place in the State, but everything is late or not at all. Patricia died in the range of the age that trans women die, she died at 41 years old, ”she asserted.
> 
> “It is the responsibility of the State because the trans labor quota does not apply. If there is a trans labor quota, the compañeras will not be practicing sexual slavery. The national, provincial, and municipal governments are responsible," he said, recalling that the national law establishes a quota of 1% that the "highest percentage stays in Buenos Aires and is not met here."
> 
> Hours before learning the news of Patricia's death, Paz along with other compañeras, militants and the lawyer for the Corrientes Human Rights Commission, Hilda Pressman, led a sit-in in front of the prosecutor's office, in Pellegrini between Rioja and San Juan. There they demanded a serious investigation into what happened to Patricia and correct communication from the Public Health professionals to the victim's family about her condition and evolution, since until then they had not received official information. Patricia died shortly after due to cardiorespiratory arrest, according to reports from the hospital. “Who cares about an injured woman on the street and even more so if she is a bitch. Nobody cares," Paz lamented and assured that they will continue to demand that the "justice investigate,
> 
> "We must investigate and find the culprits, who take responsibility for the death of this woman, militant, friend and partner, who leaves behind a family," she said and noted: "There is no safe place for us, neither our house nor our work".
> 
> Regarding what happened in the early hours of Saturday, Paz said that Patricia was accompanied by a “person who was riding a motorcycle, when a car appears that runs over the two of them and the companion gets scared and leaves. It happened at 4:30, because of the noise there are neighbors who came out and behaved very well, one of the neighbors who came out with his wife is a doctor. She wants to get up, she gives her name, last name and her ID, and she faints there to never wake up again.
> 
> Patricia's cell phone was stolen while she was unconscious on the street, however, her wallet was found "intact."
> 
> “The first day a flayer was released warning that he did not return home, that he was working. It was very strange, because she was a very neat woman, she drove within a certain radius of a few blocks, she didn't drink or take drugs. That she did not return was unthinkable, ”Paz recalled on Friday night.

> 
> From Vientos de Libertad MTE Dissidents, they rejected that “transfemicides continue to happen because of an absent State. The militant activist Patricia Ramírez always fought for the correct implementation of the transvestite labor quota in the province, and all the violated rights of the LGBTQB+ community. We demand that what happened be clarified."
> 
> The Corrientes Pride March remembered her as a "tireless fighter" and promised to "go in search of Justice, so that those who did this to you take charge and pay." From the Furia Travesti Foundation, they spoke of "La Pato" as a "solidarity and fighter companion who was an inspiration. It only remains to say that you broke all the barriers and you showed this world with so little inclusion that you could and that you can ”. And they pointed as the main person responsible, to the absent provincial State. That pushes the compañeras to marginality and death”.
> 
> The Correntina Transfeminist Force organization fired Ramírez "with enormous pain" and assured: "From each town that makes up the Correntina Transfeminist Force, we embrace the family and more than ever we will take the fight banners that La Patri always knew how to raise. We are also going to fight for Justice for La Patri, we will search and fight until each person responsible pays for his death ”.
