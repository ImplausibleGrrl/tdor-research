In Colima, journalist Roberto Macías reported for El Punto Informativo that Yaneth's murder is the first transfemicide of the year in that state. 
> 
> The request for justice of these trans women has been kept in a low profile. Regarding this, Jazz Bustamante clarifies that both families and human rights defenders "are afraid to raise their voices" because they face hyper-local contexts where "the law of criminal cells" permeates. 
> 
> And he adds, “that does not mean that the victims do not have the support of their communities, they do have it, sometimes also from their families, from the same people from the sexual dissidents of those localities, but it is very difficult that in that context they go out to demonstrate to demand justice because their own safety is at stake.”

> “The press reported everything as if it were a man and did not see it as relevant that she was a trans woman. I saw it as relevant to tell and make his identity visible and that she was a visible trans woman in his community. I also saw it as relevant to tell how she was murdered because it was a hate crime and to determine it as such it is important to talk about the aggravating causes, the cruelty and advantage over her gender identity. Yessi Montero was tortured, her genitals were cut off, she was given the 'coup de grace', what other proof do they want that it was a hate crime” , Jazz Bustamante , who has dedicated herself to record this type of crime in the state of Veracruz for more than ten years.

> The answer was: “The status of the investigation is reserved. Expert elements are already investigating what happened in Gregorio Torres Quintero (colony where the event took place) and will determine those elements with the victim's relatives."
> 
> In social networks, users condemned the event and linked it to the growing insecurity after the militarization of the state. And it is that the security strategy of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has been to send hundreds of elements of the National Guard, the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Navy.
