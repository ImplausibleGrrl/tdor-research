There was a bowling alley called Millenium where I took him by the hand and introduced him to Pancha. It was hard not to laugh with her and that was what I wanted from her. 'I'm not going to be pretty, because I'm not.' She laughed at herself and her follies. It was what we wanted to see. There was no other artist who did comedy. She was a capocomic showoman with a particular style. She made her lolas with little water bulbs and pricked one and was left with only one tit. She would lose her wigs, she would tear up the painting and she would go out late or not remember the lyrics.”

And he closed: "Today, a hate crime that adds to the list of many others that took place in Mar del Plata against our big put8s and against trans femininities. I will always carry in my heart your last appearances as Siouxsie, and those of Valeria, Thalía, Perhaps Perhaps Perhaps, Fever… Unforgettable Pancha".

While that project rests, they continue to violate and murder us."
