Last Saturday, December 24, the body of a woman was found in the Ría de Bilbao . She was floating in the water. She was carrying two two-kilo weights, each tied to her body from her so that she remained submerged under the river.

At dawn on Christmas Eve, the emergency department received a notice from a citizen. He claimed to have seen the body of a person in the estuary. The victim was found near the Hanging Bridge, in Portugalete.

An Ertzaintza patrol, from the Getxo police station, went to the scene. Once there, a Red Cross boat came to remove the lifeless body from the water. The body was placed on the Las Arenas pier, on a stretcher.

The data that is known
According to the Diario Vasco, it has been confirmed that the victim is a 40-year-old transsexual woman. She has a fair complexion, short brown hair and a tall stature. At the time she was found she was dressed in a puffer coat, jeans and designer boots. 

Despite the fact that the woman did not carry any documentation with her, the investigators could have already detected her identity. In the same way, the necro-review has been carried out, which is the identification procedure through the victim's fingerprints.

At first it was suspected that the event could be a suicide. However, after investigations by the Judicial Police of the Civil Guard and the Ertzaintza, it was declared that it was a homicide. 

The autopsy was performed at the Bilbao Legal Medicine Institute. Once carried out, it was possible to know that the victim, prior to being thrown into the water, was suffocated.

Furthermore, no water was found in his lungs. Therefore, this fact would confirm that he already fell lifeless into the estuary and did not die from drowning.

The person who threw the woman into the water attached the weights to the victim to cover her up. The culprit taped the weights to the body.

In this way, he would hide any trace of evidence. The lifeless body of the woman remained submerged for four to five days in the water.
