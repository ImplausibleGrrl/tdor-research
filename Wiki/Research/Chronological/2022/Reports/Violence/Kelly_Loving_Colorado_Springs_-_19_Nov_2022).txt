> Rest in Power to those who did not survive the Club Q attack:
1. > Daniel Aston - a trans man and bartender at Club Q who was said to be energetic and helpful per one of the drag performers there.
2. > Derrick Rump - one of the co-owners of Club Q who was bubbly and enjoyed telling jokes per one of the drag performers there.
3. > Kelly Loving - a trans woman who helped other trans women with how to be tough and move through the world as a trans woman per a friend of hers.
4. > Ashley Paugh - a straight women who leaves behind her husband and 11-yr old daughter, who had gone out for a fun night with one of her friends.
5. > Raymond Green - was there to celebrate a friends birthday with his partner.
> Two were trans lives lost moments before the Trans Day of Remembrance who will be added to the list of at least 32, now 34, trans people killed this year.  Yet we continue to see state legislatures advancing bills that target transgender people, limit local protections, and allow the use of religion to discriminate. 
> The injured count is up to 25 and I am unaware of any of their names. I can only hope they all heal from their injuries and that no more deaths are added to the list.
> Images of each person are from various news sources and posts, I do not own these images.
> Update: since this post has been circulating I’ve received contact from news sources. Please know that I was not there that night and do not personally know the victims. All information and photos have been gathered from news sources or public posts. I wanted to share their faces and a bit about each person as a tribute to them.
