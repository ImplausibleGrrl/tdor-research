> It's hard to stay positive in such a situation. I am angry. Sad might be a better word, because I have to do my best not to let the tears roll down my cheeks. I'm in the university library with a busy schedule and deadlines to meet, but I can't get my head around it. It's just been a week 2022, but it's already going with huge peaks and troughs. While I was so happy and proud this morning about the good news from MJ Rodriquez, I now feel completely lost. On the second day of the new year, the first murdered trans woman of 2022 will be a fact.
> 
> The messages have been circulating on social media in recent days: a woman had been murdered in the Van der Valk Hotel in Wassenaar . After a few days the redeeming word came out. The murdered woman was Briza Garces Florez, a 40-year-old sex worker from The Hague. Although originally from Colombia, she had lived in the Netherlands for over 20 years and had built up a large community in the The Hague area.
> 
> In addition to all these things, Briza was also a trans woman. A beautiful trans woman in the prime of her life. She was who she wanted to be, who she'd always wanted to be, and was stripped of her future. Taken from who she could have been. It pains me to see that it once again has to come to the point where trans people are murdered. It is, however, a surprise to see that many Dutch media are picking up the message. At least, compared to other murders of trans people. Perhaps because it was still unclear at first that it was a trans woman? Because in general, the murders of cisgender people are picked up much more often and the murders of transgender people go under the radar. Such was the last time the murder of Özge Bilirwho made the national news, and only after all of social media was full of this and criticized the fact that the news was not picked up. 
> 
> Now it also took a while before the national news picked up the message about the loss of Briza. The COC previously posted about the murder of Briza. Why the word transgender instead of transgender person is still used in this reporting is a question for me. However, it doesn't feel like the right time to ask this one. Because the meaning is clear: there must be justice. But also justice for Briza. She should also be addressed as who she was in the reporting about her murder. Not a transgender, but a trans woman.
> 
> Trans United Europe , a platform for BIPOC trans people, also expressed their shock by the murder. I am shocked too, but no longer surprised. Trans people are significantly more often victims of violence and violence against trans people appears to be increasing again. 2021 was even seen as the deadliest year for trans people since the Human Rights Campaign started keeping track in 2013. But as shameless as the first murder of a trans person in the Netherlands already takes place on the second day of the year, 2022 certainly seems already underway. to catch up on this. In the United States, they keep the same pace. Two trans women of color have already been murdered in just the first two days† When will it stop? How far should it go until something is done about it? I feel lost seeing what this is doing to the LGBTQIA+ community. And with the trans community. With my community. Angry media statements, sad text messages and a sense of loss travels through the community like a storm.
> 
> And this isn't the only problem facing the trans community right now. Increasingly higher rates of suicide among trans people and extremely long waiting times for trans care. Sylvana Simons (Bij1), Jeanet van der Laan (D66) and Lisa van Ginneken (D66) asked questions about this in the House of Representatives on Wednesday 12 January . One day after it is also announced that the waiting times for an intake at the gender outpatient clinic of the VU Amsterdam have increased to 900 days . A 2.5 year waiting period for an intake interview, after which a waiting period of at least six months applies before the diagnosis can begin. No wonder the suicide rates are rising under such hopeless waiting times. 
> 
> But there are also positive messages. Michaela Jaé Roqriquez became the first trans woman ever to win a Golden Globe . And of course she didn't just receive this golden statue: for her role as Blance Evangelista in the series POSE . In her emotional Instagram post she shares that this is not only for her, but also for others. 
> 
> “This is the door that is going to Open the door for many more young talented individuals. They will see that it is more than possible. They will see that a young Black Latina girl from Newark New Jersey who had a dream, to change the minds others would WITH LOVE. LOVE WINS. To my young LGBTQAI babies WE ARE HERE the door is now open now reach the stars!”
> 
> And therefore also a Golden Globe for a series that highlights all aspects of being trans so beautifully and vulnerable, including the murder of trans people. Candy's funeral episode ("Never Knew Love Like This Before" S2A4) now gets even deeper as it gets so close to reality. There is hope for what this year will bring, but I am cautiously optimistic. I hope that there are still few reports of murders of transgender people. But as long as this continues to be the case, I will continue to speak out. Because it can't go on like this. Say her name: Briza.
> 
> My thoughts go out to all of Briza's loved ones and all those affected by her murder. If you can spare the money, you can donate via this link to ensure that Briza gets the farewell she deserves.

Horrific murder of Colombian transgender Briza Garces Florez
8 January 2022-
Deeply sad news from our colleagues at Trans United: forty-year-old Briza Garces Florez was murdered on the first day of the new year in a hotel near The Hague. Briza was transgender, sex worker and was originally from Colombia. Our thoughts go out to Briza's loved ones, friends and family.

As COC Amsterdam and COC Nederland, we join Trans United: we want justice for Briza. Our community needs to be better protected from violence, and that is an important task for the new cabinet that will be sworn in on Monday.
