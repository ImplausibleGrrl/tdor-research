> Milwaukee police are investigating a homicide that occurred on Wednesday, June 15 in the 2200 block of N. Teutonia Avenue at 6:30 a.m. officers arrived on the scene to find 28 year-old Brazil Johnson dead on arrival.
> 
> Brazil who identified as a Black trans woman was said to succumb to a fatal gunshot injuries. 
> 
> The circumstances leading up to the shooting are under investigation. We are speaking with the family and assisting in the final arrangement as much as we can.
> 
> There’s multiple stories going around and due to this being an active investigation there’s not much that we can verify at this moment. Brazil would be number 17 according to HRC website following the murder of Sasha Mason, a 45-year-old Latina transgender woman from North Carolina unfortunutly it’s hard to track these murders due to bad media coverage as Brazil’s murder was covered by Fox in which they dead named and misgendered her. 
> 
> Presently Milwaukee police continue to seek unknown suspects which is a sign that they may have persons of interest. If you were in the area of Teutonia and Garfield and saw anything we encourage you to contact Milwaukee police at 414-935-7360 or to remain anonymous, contact Crime Stoppers at 414-224-Tips.        
> 
> If you’d like to support the family by sending flowers or cards please email Dee Dee Watters at imdeedeewatters@gmail.com and she’ll provide details. Flowers need to be sent by June 28th 
> To the friends family and community members we at TRansGriot send our love and condolences to you.
