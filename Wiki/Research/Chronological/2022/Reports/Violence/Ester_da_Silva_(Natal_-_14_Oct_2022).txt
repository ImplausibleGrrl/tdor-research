> I've been trying to publish the chronicle I made in honor of Teachers' Day for two weeks (I hope to publish it later this month, after all, it's still October!), but other situations that don't need to be honored , but that do be reflected on, surfaced and held my attention and stimulated me to write about.
> 
> What terrifies me and makes me put off the ode to teaching I wrote was an episode that, if it weren't real, would have been taken from a horror movie, like Saw. And that, if it were n't so cruel, it could even be taken as just the will of arrogance and power of Alice's Queen of Hearts and hers dela hysterical and iconic: "Off the head!"
> 
> However, the issue is serious, in addition to being atrocious, violent, inhuman and unacceptable. A 15-year-old transvestite was killed and her head and pinky finger decapitated and removed from the crime scene. The headless body was found this past Friday (10/14) in the North Zone of Natal/RN.
> 
> If the brutality of the crime shocks me, what terrifies me is the neglect, the lack of mobilization and social indignation, in addition to the disrespect with which this case, this body and this HUMAN BEING are treated. "Ah, but she was just a transvestite who prostituted herself." “She should even be involved in theft and drugs!”
> 
> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!! That doesn't authorize anyone to take another's life! Being a transvestite, prostituting, taking drugs, whatever is used as an excuse, as a reason to commit this barbaric crime of killing and beheading is not sustainable, it has no value, it cannot be accepted. This transvestite was a child! A person in a condition of social, emotional, family, educational vulnerability ... It was a young person who, due to her gender identity and expression, was interrupted.
> 
> And the most painful thing (because there is always one more) is that murder is not enough, right!? Parts need to be ripped off. It is necessary to make suffer, even if it is already dead! You have to do it in pieces. It is necessary to leave the “message” that our existences are worthless. That with our bodies, living or dead, we can do whatever we want.
> 
> The G1 news portal published in two articles to which I had access that “The body was released for burial, but remained at the institute's headquarters until the morning of this Wednesday (19). The victim's head had not been found until the last update of this article”; and that “A public servant who asked to have his identity her preserved told  g1  that the victim's family, who lives in Pernambuco, signed a power of attorney for the transvestite's body to be buried in São Gonçalo do Amarante, where she was living”. And it hits me again like a punch in the stomach...
> 
> In addition to the body being buried without a head, which in itself is an image to keep anyone awake at night, especially if they are Trans/Transvestites, his family demonstrates that they do not insist on burying him. Who is Travesti in the Brazilian family, in general? That entity that ceases to exist because it begins to exist. You see!? And if she is so disposable to her own family, imagine what she represents for society as a whole?! ANYTHING! NOBODY! And, therefore, liable to be treated as garbage, thing, discard.
> 
> This hideous episode will stay at that. The victim will be to blame and “Well done! Who ordered it to be this way!”. I say this because, according to the same news portal already mentioned, a suspect was arrested and assumed the murder, but... “Despite confessing to the crime, the man will respond in freedom, since he was not arrested in the act and there is no arrest warrant against him.” And someone is going to issue this mandate?! Probably not! After all, he did a good thing for society, didn't he?!
> 
> I keep imagining that the condemnation of rejection, precariousness, violence and rape, contempt and prejudice are not enough for a Travesti in life. This combo must continue to perpetuate itself on her her beyond the living body, beyond consciousness, beyond the concrete and cruel life in which most Trans / Transvestites in this country are immersed ... able to rest in peace! Amen!"
> 
> I haven't been well since Friday. And who would be?! Seeing this violence and this violation of the rights of people from the LGBTQIAPN+ community on the rise, being a person from that community?! Noting that, in the name of holiness, the so-called saints are becoming true demons loaded with anger, hatred and lack of love for others. What we are witnessing is a multiplication of the Queen of Hearts and what echoes over our existences is the terrible and real sentence: “Off with your head!”



> The body of the transvestite Ester, 15 years old, was found dead on the premises of the municipal polyclinic, in the Santa Catarina neighborhood, North Zone of Natal. The information was confirmed by friends Raquel and Júlia (fictitious names), this Monday (17), exclusively to TV Ponta Negra reporter, Rogério Fernandes. Ester's name is Ismael Gomes da Silva, born in Olinda (PE).
> 
> According to friends, they recognized Ester's body by the clothes she was wearing the day she left home. Júlia said that she met the teenager on the abandoned street, talked to her, felt confident and decided to take her home. “She said that she had come from Recife two months ago with two girls, but that she had nowhere to stay,” she recalls.
> 
> Upon learning of her friend's death, Rachel contacted Ester's family, in Pernambuco, to let them know what had happened, however - according to her - the family treated her badly and would have said that she could bury the teenager's body. “We can't do anything, bury it right there. People, where is the love of this family for this child? That's why Esther left home”, believes Rachel.
> 
> Rachel and Júlia say that the family did not send documentation and, for now, Ester's body remains at Itep awaiting release. “To release and organize the burial we need a power of attorney, but so far nothing has been resolved because we don't have a document. We want justice for Ester and for the other two who have died in the same place”, said Rachel.



> Body of a transvestite is found decapitated and without one of the fingers in a polyclinic in the North
>  October 14, 2022
> 
> The body of a transvestite was found on the morning of this Friday (14), around 5 am, at Policlínica Norte, in the Potengi neighborhood, north of Natal. According to the RondasS team of the Municipal Guard, triggered to the scene, the body was with blood around and without the head and a finger.
> 
> The team isolated the area and the Instituto Técnico Científico de Perícia (ITEP) was called to collect the body. Military and Civil Police teams were also at the scene.
> 
> Suspicions are that the crime took place in another region and, subsequently, the victim's body was dumped in the outside area of ??the Polyclinic. According to the Municipal Guard, the corpse was identified while a guard in the building carried out the routine patrol.
> 
> The transvestite's body was wearing a black miniskirt and a yellow blouse. The head of the body and one of her fingers were not found on the premises of the polyclinic. There is still no information on the identity of the victim and those responsible for the crime. The case will be investigated by the Civil Police.
