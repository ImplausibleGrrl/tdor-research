> Loren Guzmán, a trans woman who disappeared on December 3, 2021, was found lifeless in Irapuato, Guanajuato, as reported on social networks.
> 
> The woman was employed as a stylist and was last seen leaving her home on calle Parra in the Flores Magón Sur neighborhood, in the municipality of Irapuato.
> 
> Regarding this fact, the director of the association 'Human Development and Sexuality (Dehusex) of Irapuato', Arturo Álvarez Martínez, asked the State Attorney General's Office (FGE) to investigate and not only be one more homicide, than what could have been actually a hate crime.
> 
> “We are asking the Prosecutor's Office to do the same, to do it and not stay like a dead person or another dead person and there it stayed and that's it, it was for robbery, it was for assault, because it was wrong. In the case of this girl, it was not known that she was wrong, but the way in which they are murdered there is a lot of hate, that was hate for transphobia and what has happened with colleagues in Irapuato but since they are issues related to mafias they do not give them the attention they they should give him," he said.
> 
> And it is that he detailed that a person shot to death is not the same as locating a mutilated, disfigured body, which makes a difference between a homicide and a hate crime.
> 
> “For the LGBT community, it represents one more death, one more person, since trans women are being murdered at the national level, they are being violated with hate,” said Arturo Álvarez.
