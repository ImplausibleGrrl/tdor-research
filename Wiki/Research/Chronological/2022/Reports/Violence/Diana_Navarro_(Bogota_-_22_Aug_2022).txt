> Diana Navarro, leader and defender of the rights of the LGBTIQ+ population, as well as the first trans woman to belong to the leadership of a political party in Colombia, apparently died this Monday.
> 
> William Enrique Navarro, with the name that Diana was baptized, had to register like this at the Polo Democrático because not having had an operation and being called that in her documents forced her to remain in the records as something she did not feel: a man.
> 
> However, she was already recognized as Diana Navarro and was an active member of Polo de Rosa, the LGBTIQ+ sector of this party when she came to the leadership. Her struggle, according to a profile made by a media outlet in 2006, began outside the games, since she went against the current from a school in Barranquilla by declaring herself homosexual and beginning to recognize that she felt like a woman.
> 
> Before doing activism from the Democratic Pole, Diana Navarro was in the NGO Conspira, which she joined when she was a sex worker and described herself as a transvestite instead of a trans woman. She later was in the LGBT Table of Bogotá, to later be of the Polo de Rosa.
> 
> It was from that place that he began and continued until his death: defending the rights of the LGBTIQ+ population and sex workers, that in many cases the same person belongs to both communities, because society relegates them and takes away rights such as education, work and decent housing.
> 
> Diana Navarro was chosen in 2006 to be one of the eight people in the leadership of the Polo Democrático at the national level and, just as at this moment when she dies, she is valued by sectors of the left, such as President Gustavo Petro, who dedicated a trill to her lamenting his death.

I am Diana Navarro, black, queer and whore, no more , ”she commented in a chat with the Colombian portal.

They didn't kick me out of my house, I decided it” , she recalled in that same conversation. She came to work in a hairdressing salon, however, some time later she left there, according to her, due to envy against her. After that, it was when her first proposals to engage in sex work came into her life. “Like all Colombian workers, he rents out his body from time to time,” she said about prostitution.
> 
> Some time later, and after the death of her partner, whom she met working as a prostitute, she left for Medellín and enrolled in university. Although she did not sign up to study law, she said, her life led her to that profession. "I was the first transvestite to start professional studies in Colombia, as a transvestite," she recounted in the audiovisual special that Mar de Leva made for her. After receiving death threats in the capital of the department of Antioquia and being the victim of an attack, she decided to return to Bogotá to start the fight that she carried out until the last day of her life.
> 
> Already in the Colombian capital, in 2008, she was appointed by sex workers as their representative. According to her, she was not afraid to confront authority to defend her rights and those of her colleagues. “I am capable of taking on a local mayor,” she stressed. From there the Girasol group was born, to later create the corporation Option: for the right to be and the duty to do. “There we only worked whores and queers” , she detailed.
