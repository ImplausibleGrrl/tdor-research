> Kesha Webster was found dead on Charleston Drive in Jackson, Mississipi on Saturday, March 26, 2022. Her death is under investigation with family telling the media it was a ‘robbery-homicide’ but no further information from local law enforcement. I haven’t been able to find any media reports of the incident itself.
> 
> Kesha’s mother wants to raise the profile of her child’s life and death. Please note that most existing media coverage uses Kesha’s dead name and mixes pronouns.
> 
> ”Everybody share it all on Facebook,” said Kesha’s mom, Sharon Taylor. “All over Facebook. Let it go out, because I want justice for my baby. Because she was loved. She had plenty of love. She didn’t deserve that. She ain’t no dog, no rag or dirt. She’s gonna get justice.”
> 
> Ms. Taylor is the fierce mom everyone deserves. While I am so sad for broken heart, I hope she finds comfort knowing that her love for her daughter made a difference.
> 
> Kesha’s family seems to have accepted and embraced her in her true identity, but they still stumble over the language. This is very different, IMHO, than people who intentionally erase their loved one’s lived identity or refuse to even try to understand and be respectful. Kesha’s closeness with her mother and other family members suggests that there was a genuine desire to know each other in their most authentic self as well as an awareness of the vulnerability Kesha confronted each day.
> 
> Kesha also seemed well aware and posted this on her Facebook profile just five days before her death. Was it referencing a specific threat? Was it related to her death? Was it just a premonition? I don’t know, but I do recognize that most cisgender gay and lesbian folks, especially those of us who are white, do not carry this weight around in our day-to-day lives. We must be mindful to listen to other BIPOC trans folx and provide the resources they need to flourish rather than fear.

> Kesha worked at Aeropostale and previously at Hollister Co. after graduating from Callaway High School. She traveled frequently throughout Southern states. She turned 24 in February of this year. According to her Facebook profile, her faith was important to her as was her family. She enjoyed meeting new people and posted a lot of hopeful content, suggesting she was an optimistic person.
> 
> Family and friends gathered on April 1, 2022 for a memorial vigil and to call for anyone with information to say something. You can reach the Jackson police at (601) 960-1217.
> 
> Kesha is the ninth transgender person reported as a victim of fatal violence in 2022. She is the fifth Black trans woman and the seventh woman of color from these neighbors. At age 24, she is among the younger victims as eight are under 30 and one was 33 at the times of their deaths. Their deaths come on the heels of 2021, the most violent year in recorded history with the deaths of 57 trans, non-binary, and gender nonconforming people in the United States alone. Note that the tabulation includes a significant number of reports of folx murdered in 2021. This might be confusing. Of course it is confusing. I tried to sort it out below.
> 
> Rest in power, Kesha. You deserved better, you deserved a long life filled with joy and happiness. Thank you for all that your brought into this world, thank you for making it a better place for so many of your loved ones. I am sorry we failed to create a safer world for you.
> 
> May your memory be a revolution.


> JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - Friday night, family and friends gathered to celebrate the life of a loved one who was taken from them too soon.
> 
> More than a hundred people attended the balloon release honoring Kenyatta Webster, who went by Kesha.
> 
> Family members say Webster was found dead on Charleston Drive Saturday morning.
> 
> Now, the family is seeking justice and those who were close to Webster say they are shocked and heartbroken.
> 
> ”Everybody share it all on Facebook,” said Kenyatta’s mom, Sharon Taylor. “All over Facebook. Let it go out, because I want justice for my baby. Because she was loved. She had plenty of love. She didn’t deserve that. She ain’t no dog, no rag or dirt. She’s gonna get justice.”
> 
> Jackson police have not released any information about Webster’s death.
