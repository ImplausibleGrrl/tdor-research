> On the afternoon of Saturday, January 29,  Le贸n Pindo Cuenca , a trans man , was murdered in the province of El Oro in a hit-man style, while traveling on a bus belonging to Oro Express.
> 
> While the vehicle was being transported from La Soborna, near Tilalles, two individuals on a motorcycle threatened to shoot at the vehicle to stop it. One of them got on the bus and killed the 35-year-old with six shots. They appear to have been hired assassins as the individual did not steal any belongings from the murdered person or from the rest of the passengers. According to records of the Runa Sipiy Report of the Silhouette X Association, this violent act is the fourth so far this year against people from the LGBTI community.
