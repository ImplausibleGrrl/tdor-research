> Renato Estrada, a 43-year-old trans man and member of Colectivo El Trébol, was killed yesterday, September 6. He was attacked in a bar located in Colonia Landívar. His murder is in addition to those of 19 other LGBTIQ+ people that occurred during 2022.
> 
> Ilse Contreras, president of the El Trébol Collective, said they do not know the motive for the murder, as Renato had no problems with anyone. "He was very helpful and friendly, he didn't look for problems," he explained. The police are investigating the facts, and will keep the family informed.
> 
> According to Contreras, the murder of his partner was a hate crime. "He had told us that he knew a lot of people who had a phobia of trans men. The reason is that: the rejection of us and our identity," he said.
> 
> Other LGBTIQ+ killings
> 
> Renato's murder is not the first of its kind. On July 2, Nancy Sacul Tut, a trans woman and member of the El Trébol Collective, was wounded at 9:30 p.m. with a firearm. "The hate crimes, rejection and repudiation of our identities continue," Contreras said.
> 
> The National Observatory of LGBTIQ+ Human Rights reported that, during the first 7 days of September, 2 violent deaths were registered against LGBTIQ+ people. So far in 2022, another 18 have been killed.
> 
> Other forms of violence
> 
> While murder is the greatest expression of violence, Ilse Contreras points out that there are others to which LGBTIQ+ people are subjected, such as beatings and insults. The reason: their gender identity. "They reject us just because we are different, humiliate us and beat us mercilessly," he explained.
> 
> According to the Diálogos think tank, during 2021, 164 acts of violence against the LGBTIQ+ population were reported. From January to May 2022, another 29 were reported. But, there are weaknesses in collecting this information: "There is a lack of technical understanding about the difference between sexual orientation and gender identity," they said. For this reason, the data is collected only by self-perception.
> 
> The denunciations of acts of violence against LGBTIQ+ people allow us to measure the magnitude of this phenomenon. However, they do not manifest reality: some crimes are never reported and remain unpunished.
> 
> The Call to Justice
> 
> The El Trébol Collective repudiates the murder of its companion. "We demand that justice be done and that it arrive on time," Contreras said. Together with other organizations, they have carried out various actions to demand that the State eradicate this problem. Some of them are the presentation of memorandums and complaints to the Public Prosecutor's Office (MP) and the Office of the Human Rights Ombudsman (PDH). However, there has been no response from government entities.
