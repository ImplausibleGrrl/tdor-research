> “Justice for Priscilla”. That's what the posters spread by the hands of friends and family during the funeral of Priscila Santos, known as Priscila Diva, said ela. 
> 
> The 29-year-old  trans woman and resident of the Perus neighborhood , northwest region of the city of São Paulo, was found dead last Tuesday (22/3) in the municipality of Mairiporã, in the metropolitan region.
> 
> Last seen on Thursday (17/3), she left the house around 9pm, the time she always used to leave for work. During her wake, her mother remembered the scene that was often repeated: “she took a walk, tossed her hair and left”.
> 
> Unlike the others, on this day Priscila left the house only in flip-flops, shorts and a top, without a cell phone or documents.
> 
> “She was last seen on Rua Mogeiro, with Av. Dr Silvio de Campos, in Perus. We stayed behind her, asking a lot of people, ”says her sister Suellen Teixeira, who even went to hospitals and posted search ads on social media.
> 
> The young woman's death is still under investigation at the Franco da Rocha Police Station, in the municipality of Grande SP, where the body was taken after being found in a state of decomposition in the Mairiporã dam. The coffin was sealed, with only a photo of the young woman's face.
> 
> “The case is being investigated by the Franco da Rocha Police Station. The unit's team works to elucidate the facts and arrest the author. More details will be preserved to guarantee the autonomy of police work”, the Secretary of Public Security of the state of São Paulo said in a note to Nós, women from the periphery.
> 
> The family has been careful to protect Priscila's memory of her, since false news about her body condition has been disseminated throughout the neighborhood. “My husband and her brother recognized her body. She did not have her hair shaved, nor her private parts of her mutilated as she has been falsely disseminated throughout the neighborhood,” says Sister Suellen.

> 'Fear of leaving and not knowing if we will return'
> “I am deeply shocked, because this is not the first time this has happened in Perus,” says friend Safira Rodrigues de Souza, also transgender. “Years go by, when we think the trauma has passed a little, it happens again with Priscila. Where are we going to stop? It's one thing to be afraid of going out and being robbed. Another thing is you are afraid to leave and not know if you will come back”.
> 
> Sapphire's fear spreads across the country. Brazil is the country that kills the most trans people in the world. The average life span of a trans person in the country is just 35 years. According to data from Transgender Europe (TGEU), Brazil has recorded 41% of all murders of transgender people worldwide.
> 
> As of September 30, 2021, there were 125 murders. ANTRA (National Association of Transvestites and Transsexuals) showed that, in 2020, the number of violent deaths reached 175. Most victims are black.
> 
> “Just as they did with them, they will want to do it with us. I think someone should take action. There are people who even accept it, but after they drink one or two, then the humiliation begins. There are those who curse and there are people who join in and attack us”, laments Safira, who has experienced transphobia since adolescence.
> 
> 'Priscila was special to many people'
> Born on December 11, 1992, Priscila was the daughter of Dona Irene dos Santos, sister of Suellen, Luana, Diego, Taise and Diógenes. Her nephews and her nieces, even without understanding her departure, cried for her aunt.

> “He was a very outgoing person. Cheerful and smiling. She spoke well. She was always well-groomed. She was very special to many people”, is what, amid the whirlwind of information and emotions, says Sister Suellen Teixeira.
> 
> She grew up in Perus and some friends from school days are still friends today. This is the case of Talysson Ferreira, who reaffirms how much Priscila was loved by everyone.
> 
> “Priscilla was a wonderful person. Humble, simple, sweet in the way she talks or looks. Where she went, she made friends”, says the neighbor, with whom she studied as a child at Emef – Escola Municipal de Ensino Fundamental Jairo de Almeida, in Recanto dos Humildes, where she lived.
> 
> In one of the last times they saw each other, she presented him with glasses, which he wore during the wake, as a tribute to her friend. “She gave me something that is here with me, which is the glasses, which I brought as a tribute. It's very sad to lose a person like that, so special, since we were little we knew each other”.
> 
> 'One of the first trans women in Perus'
> In the region, Priscila was well known, mainly for having paved the way for other girls and women in their identification processes as trans women and transvestites.
> 
> “I followed her trajectory and her suffering, because it was not easy. It's not easy for any of us. For me, she was the diva, she who started as a trans woman here in Perus. She suffered a lot to initiate and take action and give strength to other women, because none of them had the courage yet,” says Talysson.
> 
> “She gave everyone the courage to come out and be proud of who she is. Only queen you'll have here in Perus. Our turkey diva”, says his friend Talysson with emotion.
> 
> “She lived to have her body. She managed to mount herself. She worked for her. To buy her perfumes, her clothes, her heels, she was a person who didn't ask anyone for anything, she supported herself and helped people a lot”, adds Safira, who came to accompany Priscila a few times during the programs she performed. The family also says that her mother, Irene, also always helped Priscila financially.
> 
> 'There was no sadness around Priscila'
> Extroverted and cheerful are some of the synonyms used by some of the more than 70 people who attended Priscila's wake and burial this Thursday (24), at the Dom Bosco Cemetery, in Perus.
> 
> “There was no sadness around Priscila. Anyone who came close to her sad quickly, she would lift the spirits with her playful way of being”, says Safira.
> 
> For Flávia dos Santos Oliveira, 30, she was her best friend, who cheered her up by always repeating a phrase: “what the hell, friend”.
> 
> “Everything I needed I talked to her. She was an amazing girl. Priscilla was killed in such a way that even I can't believe it. For me, this is coming as a shock. I want justice for my friend. I want a lot of justice, what they did to her will not go unpunished”, claims Flávia.
> 
> Faced with cases like Priscila's and also thinking about LGBTQIA+ people who live on the streets in the neighborhood of Perus, resident Paula Roberta Ferraz created  TransAfeto .
> 
> “The project aims to bring food to the homeless LGBTQIA+ population, clothes, shoes, blankets, water, tents and affection. The focus of the project is on trans people”, says Paula, president and founder of TransAfeto.
> 
> For her, as Perus does not have a reception center for this population, the project becomes an important space for emotional support. “I think it is necessary to have a support house that welcomes the LGBTQIA+ public, as there is a lack of support in Turkeys for this population. There is a lack of a place that can give professional courses, as they are often excluded”.
> 
> For those who are looking for support or want to help the project, it is possible to get in touch through the  TransAfeto profile on Instagram  and speak directly with Paula.
