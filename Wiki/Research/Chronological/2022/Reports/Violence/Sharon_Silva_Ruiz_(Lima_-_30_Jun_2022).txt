shot

> A trans woman was shot dead this morning by alleged foreign pimps, at the height of the 13th block of Avenida Petit Thouars, in the neighborhood of Lima.
> 
> Seriously injured, the trans woman -who works in prostitution- was taken to the Hospital Dos de Mayo emergency room where her condition is delicate.
> 
> At the scene of the attack, National Police agents found several shell casings and the trace of a projectile on a metal door. The case is under investigation, in order to identify the attackers.
> 
> In dialogue with RPP News , a friend of the victim, whom she identified as 'Sharon', said that the trans woman had received threats days before the attack by alleged foreign pimps for refusing to pay the allowances.
> 
> “The one who was collecting (fees) before, I think is now in jail. Now I think it's the Venezuelans who take quotas, everyone pays quotas. I understand that. I think they pay between 150 and 200 a week,” he said.
> 
> Another friend of 'Sharon' pointed out that a few days ago trans women who work in prostitution received a message on WhatsApp, in which they had to pay fees to be able to work. In the text, the alleged pimps identify themselves as members of the 'Tren', which would be a reference to the dangerous Venezuelan megaband 'Tren de Aragua'.
> 
> “As of today, all the pages of Peru are invaded by the 'Train'. All trans women who want to work have to stand in line, just like women," the message said.
> 
> This attack on a prostitute is not an isolated case in Lima . On March 22, in Lurín, a trans sex worker was shot to death for refusing to pay fees; while a few weeks ago, in Cercado de Lima, two prostitutes were shot to death in Jirón Zepita, also for refusing to pay their fees.






> "If we don't pay, they kill us": 'Tren de Aragua' riddles a trans woman who refused to pay quotas
> The victim was shot four times by a subject who posed as a parishioner and who would be part of the aforementioned foreign criminal network. They denounce threats by WhatsApp.
> The attack would have been committed by a foreign criminal mafia related to the collection of quotas and that has been threatening them on WhatsApp.
> 
> 
> They not only have to fight against discrimination, but also against the mafias. Last Wednesday night, a trans woman was riddled with bullets in the 13th block of Petit Thouars Avenue, in the Lince district, by a hit man who posed as a parishioner and who would belong to a foreign criminal network dedicated to quota collection.
> 
> This is Sharon Silva Ruíz , 39, who arrived alone from the department of Loreto to Lima nine months ago and who is now torn between life and death at the Dos de Mayo Hospital, after receiving four shots in the body. .
> 
> According to some of Silva Ruíz's colleagues, the attack would have been committed by a foreign criminal mafia related to the collection of quotas and that has been threatening them on WhatsApp for some time now. This would be the 'Tren de Aragua' , according to the messages they showed to the newscast.
> 
> "They are sending this on the pages where we publish ourselves to work. They tell us that we have to pay quotas and if we do not pay, they will supposedly cite us as people who are going to hire us to offer our services and they are going to kill us and they are going to record us", expressed a woman in the morning.
> 
> "I think they are Venezuelans who are asking for quotas. Even the girls who work on the 20 (block) of Arenales pay quotas . I understand that. I think it is between S/ 150 or S/ 200 weekly," added another victim of extortion.
> 
> On the other hand, they clarified that all trans women who work do not pay to be on the street and do not intend to do so either, despite constant threats. "After this I'm going to work in fear," said Sharon's friend.
