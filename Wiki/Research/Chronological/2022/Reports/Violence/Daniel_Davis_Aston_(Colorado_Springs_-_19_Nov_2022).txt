COLORADO SPRINGS — Members of the LGBTQ community here were confronting a shattered sense of safety Sunday after a gunman opened fire at a gay and lesbian nightclub Saturday night, killing at least five people and injuring 25 others.

Club Q described the violence,on the eve of the Transgender Day of Remembrance, as a “hate attack.” Officials said that they were investigating whether the shooting was a hate crime and that they would seek murder charges for the suspect, a 22-year-old man who was previously arrested for allegedly making a bomb threat.

The suspect was in custody and being treated for injuries at a hospital Sunday morning, Lt. Pamela Castro, a police spokesperson, told reporters. She declined to comment on a motive and said the FBI was assisting in the investigation.

Here’s what to know

Police identified the lone suspect as Anderson Lee Aldrich. He was injured and subdued, authorities said, after firing with a “long gun.”
Some patrons at the club “confronted and fought” the shooter, preventing others from being killed, police said.
At least two people were in critical condition Sunday. Authorities had not released the identities of the victims.
President Biden sent a message of support to LGBTQ people and said the attack was part of “horrific hate violence” that has plagued the country in recent years. “Gun violence continues to have a devastating and particular impact on LGBTQI+ communities across our nation and threats of violence are increasing,” he said in a statement.
Francis and Sands reported from London, Somasundaram and Iati from Washington, and Brasch from Atlanta.

The dead included bartender Daniel Aston, 28, of Colorado Springs, according to his mother, Sabrina Aston.

“We just found out today,” Aston, 67, a retired respiratory therapist, said by phone from her home in Colorado Springs.

Aston said she and her husband were notified Sunday morning when a detective and patient advocate came to the couple’s house.

“We’re not sure what happened to Daniel. He was heading outside toward the patio to smoke, which I’d been telling him not to. I guess he got caught in the crossfire,” she said. “Some guys jumped on the shooter and saved some people. Unfortunately, it wasn’t Daniel. He never made it to the hospital.”

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis (D) said the shooting was “horrific, sickening, and devastating,” in a statement on Sunday. Polis, the first openly gay governor in the country, thanked first responders andpeople at Club Q who blocked the gunman. “Colorado stands with our LGBTQ Community and everyone impacted by this tragedy as we mourn,” Polis wrote.

Later Sunday, his office said in a news release that he had ordered flags lowered to half-staff “on all public buildings statewide from sunrise tomorrow morning until sunset on November 26, 2022, to honor and remember the victims of the horrific shooting at Club Q in Colorado Springs.”
