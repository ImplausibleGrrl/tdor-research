> Communication professionals from Entre Ríos repudiated the disclosure of a police bulletin with data on the murder of a young transgender woman in Concordia, in which her right to identity, intimacy and comprehensive protection as a victim was not respected. "Ignorance or lack of training on these issues means that police reports continue to fail to comply with fundamental human rights recognized by law," they assured through a statement to which DIARIOJUNIO had access. 
> 
> "As communication professionals we call for the consideration of the information that is poured into the police reports that violate the rights of people", begins the text signed by journalists from all over the province in rejection of the police bulletin that this Wednesday spread sexist and discriminatory information about the identity of Fernanda López, the young trans woman murdered in the city of Concordia.
> 
> Right there, they assured that "every time data is leaked that does not respect the right to identity, privacy, and comprehensive protection of victims, a systematic act of re-victimization occurs."
> 
> Therefore, they demanded that the Police "as a source of official information, essential for access to public information" provide data based on the principles established by law, "respecting the full guarantee of rights, in a plan of comprehensive protection of the victims".
> 
> "We want to remember that it is an essential task of the role of the media to develop professional ethics from the Human Rights approach in all work, especially in the choice and reproduction of information sources that could violate essential rights. of the people”, they added in this regard.
> 
> Along these lines, and by way of reflection, they questioned how the data provided by police sources is checked and with what newsworthiness criteria non-sexist communication is constructed, while pointing out that it is urgent to incorporate a gender perspective and of human rights in police sources of information and, therefore, in the media.
> 
> They warned that "beyond the personal processes and the environment of the people referred to, Law 26,743 on Gender Identity establishes the recognition of self-perceived identity and enables all people to modify their DNI and other personal documents in order to respect the name of choice and the gender with which they perceive themselves”.
> 
> “With regulations like these, the Argentine State recognizes gender identity as a fundamental human right, without pathologizing it or prosecuting it. Ignorance or lack of training on these issues means that police reports continue to fail to comply with fundamental human rights recognized by law,” they concluded.
