> Robbery does not mean "robbery followed by death", in fact, this popular saying comes from the press itself. Robbery, means that due to theft, had the result of death, that is, killed to steal or stole and then killed. That is the true meaning of robbery.

> Unfortunately, Patos and Patrocínio surprise me more with violence than progress and culture. Robbery followed by death carries considerable weight that will be applied to the culprits. May the police succeed quickly. My sincere condolences to the victim's relatives.

> Do you know if there will be a funeral? I really wanted to say goodbye. I worked with him for years, we were good friends. But I lost contact since he became chemical dependent. What an irony of fate. He worked hard to help pay for his mother's clinic and later she invited him to try the crack curse. And that was the tragic end. He didn't deserve it. I will always remember the beautiful makeup and hairstyles he performed, the good mood, the high spirits. Finally, may God have mercy on his soul and receive him with light. #peace ????

> He was dragged from little house.cowardice, he must have gathered several noias to kill him. Life on crack is worthless. Living dead wiping out himself and his family. In the past, this faction that the open mouths, horns of the city beat in the chest, claiming to be part of, was not in favor of crack. Saying that drug dealer has a code of honor is a joke. Even more here where the dealers and snitch, Jack and talarico

> I sent my comment by accident with some errors and before I could finish. Regardless of whether or not the crime has to do with the girl's transsexuality, I don't think it's good to call her a "transvestite", as if she were a different person from the others. It's also important to investigate whether they didn't kill her for that, out of sheer prejudice, since they could have just taken the money. Perhaps this interfered with the violence.

> The person in question had a profession, a hairdresser of great talent and humility. He had a family, he had principles, and he received excellent education and support. He became a drug addict, got sick. He received care, help and all the affection from his grandmother and uncle. But the disease that blinds the individual and causes him to relapse, took him out of focus, took him away from a healthy life, robbed him of his decency, but it did not rob him of his heart. He was infinitely a better human being than you are. He would never position himself superior like you, who is perfect and above good and bad. May God keep and bless you always.
