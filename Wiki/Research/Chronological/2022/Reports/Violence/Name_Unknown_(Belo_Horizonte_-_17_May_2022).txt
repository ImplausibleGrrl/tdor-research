> 
> A transgender woman was found dead in the GoiÃ¢nia neighborhood, in the northeast region of Belo Horizonte, on Tuesday night (17).
> 
> According to the Military Police, the victim, who has not been identified, had several injuries on his body. Security camera footage shows she was thrown out of a car, beaten and run over twice.
> 
> In the images, it is possible to see that the car stops in an alley. Shortly thereafter, the driver turns off the vehicle and, just over a minute later, climbs out of the driver's door dragging a person by the hair.
> 
> The victim is kicked and thrown against a wall. The assailant then gets back in the car, starts the vehicle and drives away. Later, the vehicle returns and runs over the victim a second time. With the action, the woman is trapped in the car and is dragged on the floor of the car.
> 
> The expertise was called and during the work it was confirmed that the victim was a transsexual. The wounds proved that she had no marks of gunshots or knife blows, only bruises and abrasions.
> 
> The murder is investigated by the Civil Police. The suspicion is that the motive for the crime is a disagreement during a sexual program, but other hypotheses are not ruled out, as the perpetrator showed unusual anger, which suggests some kind of previous relationship with the victim.
> 
> The Civil Police said in a note that a police investigation was launched. "The investigation, which determines the authorship, motivation and dynamics of the facts, is being processed by the Department of Homicide Investigation and Protection of the Person (DHPP)", he explains.
