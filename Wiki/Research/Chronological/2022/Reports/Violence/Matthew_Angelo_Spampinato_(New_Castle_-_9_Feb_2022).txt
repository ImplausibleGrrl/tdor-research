> Matthew Angelo Spampinato, a 21-year-old white transgender man, was a barista at a Starbucks in New Castle, Delaware. Customers and employees described him as bright, kind and “a breath of fresh air.” One coworker said “He was always so selfless. He would always ask how everybody was doing even when he wasn’t having a good day himself.” A regular at the store described him as having “a smile that could turn a day around.”
> 
> On Feb. 9, 2022, Spampinato was killed in a hit and run car crash in New Castle. Spampinato’s death is at least the fifth violent killing of a transgender or gender non-conforming person in 2022. We say “at least” because too often these deaths go unreported — or misreported. In 2021, despite limitations in reporting, HRC officially recorded the largest number of fatal trans violence incidents for a second consecutive year since we began tracking this violence in 2013.
> 
> According to local news, Spampinato had recently moved to Delaware after visiting a friend and falling in love with the area. After his move, he wrote on Instagram that he was “enjoying experiencing fall and winter in a new state for the first time.” He also shared updates on his transition on social media, describing that he waited four years to obtain a prescription for testosterone and writing “I’m glad I didn’t give up.”
> 
> Spampinato's cousin described him as “very headstrong…Once he set his mind on something, he went with it…I want people to think of him as a human being who had a family (and) who had people that loved him. I would give anything just to be able to see him.” Spampinato wrote that he realized he was not cisgender at age 13 and although not everyone in his life was supportive, he appreciated those who were.
> 
> Matthew’s death is tragic, but the one shining light was that he lived his life surrounded by people who loved and respected him. He was living his dream with a healthy support system. With all of the challenges trans and non-binary people face in society, including a disregard for our lives, it is so important for allies to celebrate and uplift our community. May Matthew never be forgotten by those who loved him and those who hold our community dear.”

> Tori Cooper, Human Rights Campaign Director of Community Engagement for the Transgender Justice Initiative
> Police initially identified Spampinato by his birth name, but he was later confirmed as transgender and in the process of legally transitioning when he died. According to state police spokesman Sr. Cpl. Jason Hatchell, “investigators do not have any new leads on the driver that killed him.”

> NEW CASTLE, Del. - A family is searching for answers after a 21-year-old was killed in a hit-and-run in New Castle, Delaware.
> 
> Mary Spampinato-Moses said her child was born Isabella Spampinato and identified as Matthew.
> 
> On Saturday, Moses and her husband came up from Georgia to walk the route Matthew walked before he was hit and killed on Feb. 9 and with every step they take on Matthew’s final route, they think about what the world lost.
> 
> "I’m so angry right now," said Spampinato-Moses. "If they would have just stopped, I probably wouldn’t be this angry."
> 
> Matthew moved to the Delaware Valley last year and was a big advocate for the LQBTQ community and a beloved member of the Starbucks team.
> 
> "I’m so happy that they became everything they wanted to be," said Spampinato-Moses.  "They just had so much love to give to everybody and they had so much more to give the world."
> 
> Matthew was an artist and was hoping to return to school to pursue some of his passions.
> 
> "I just keep hearing him say ‘But, I wasn’t done yet. I just wasn’t done yet, ya know?’"
> 
> SKYFOX was over the scene on Frenchtown Road in the area of Quigley Boulevard, in New Castle. Matthew had started to walk home after a shift and went back to collect tips from his job. Police told the family Matthew was walking in the grass far from where cars should be when he was hit.
> 
> Michael Moses, Matthew’s stepfather, was fighting back tears and anger as he asked for anyone who knows anything to come forward.
> 
> "Nobody deserves to go through this," Moses cried.  "I don’t wish it on my worst enemy.  Whoever done it knows they done it because they stopped and then left him there to die."
> 
> The only information the family has on a vehicle description is that it’s a dark-colored SUV.
> 
> His parents can see how many people Matthew touched in his short time in Delaware. The Starbucks where he was employed, as well as a few other Starbucks locations shut down for a day in his honor and set up a memorial.
> 
> "They took a real life angel that was on earth away," Moses remarked. "Somebody that would do anything for you and never ask for nothing in return."
> 
> A GoFundMe has been set up to help out the family and to offer a reward for any information that leads to an arrest.
> 
> Anyone with any knowledge of the incident is urged to contact Cpl. Forester at 302-365-8465.
