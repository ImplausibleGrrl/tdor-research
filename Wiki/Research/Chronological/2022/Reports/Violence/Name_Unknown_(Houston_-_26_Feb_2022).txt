A transgender woman was fatally shot Saturday inside her apartment in southwest Houston, police said.  

The woman, who has not been publicly identified, was found with multiple gunshot wounds in the apartment in the 6600 block of Dunlap. Her boyfriend initially called police at 8 p.m. after coming upon her body, according to police. 

Police said the woman appeared to live alone, and the door was unlocked when officers arrived. They found multiple shell casings in the apartment. 

According to a recent report from the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ+ advocacy organization, last year was the deadliest on record for transgender and gender non-conforming people with at least 47 killed. 

Anyone with information about the Houston case can call the Houston Police Department's homicide division at 713-308-3600 or Crime Stoppers 713-222-TIPS (8477).
