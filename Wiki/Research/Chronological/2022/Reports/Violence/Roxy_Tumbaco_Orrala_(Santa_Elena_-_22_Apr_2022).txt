After 10:30 p.m., Roxy was outside her home in the company of several of her relatives, when her perpetrators got out of one of the vehicles and shot her at close range. After the event, police units began investigations finding the whereabouts of the two vehicles involved in this new violent death in the province of Santa Elena. In the midst of tears and pain from the relatives of Roxy Tumbaco, her body was transferred to the municipal amphitheater for the respective autopsy of law.

> This same day in the province of Guayas, close to the province of Santa Elena, on the Ecuadorian coast, Carlos Fuentes, a gay man whose gender expression was feminine and who was popularly known as "La Peter", was murdered by beheading. In this case there is little information, so we do not want to speculate until the authorities clarify the event. Peter, who was 60 years old, was murdered at Stella Maris, Guasmo Sur, where he had his hairdresser.

> For all the reasons described, we call on the State Attorney General, Diana Salazar, the Commander of the Police, Carlos Cabrera, the new Undersecretary of Diversities Alexander Guano, the Ombudsman of Ecuador (e), Cesar C贸rdoba Valverde, to carry out the necessary coordination to find the culprit or culprits, of this fact that once again mourns our community during the present.
