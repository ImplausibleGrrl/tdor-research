> 
> "Gustavo is behaving strangely here. I'm scared. If he kills me, you know." The message, to which the Diário had access, was sent by the nursing technician Sabrina Fernanda de Oliveira, 29, to a friend, shortly before being murdered by the mechanic Gustavo Bernardo Paina, 22, last Friday, 11.
> 
> The victim said that the boy, with whom she had been in a relationship for a short time, wanted to tie her up and had something hidden behind his back. In response, she was advised to pray.
> 
> As soon as she learned of the crime, the friend to whom Sabrina sent the message went to the victim's address and showed the cell phone to civil police officers. "The conversation is one of the evidence that links the perpetrator to the crime scene. Based on the messages, we identified the then suspect. It is also a contradiction. When he was arrested, he stated that he had met Sabrina recently and did not know she was transgender. But he was heard again and he changed the version, saying he knew, and gave another motive for the crime", said police chief Paulo Buchala Júnior, without mentioning details.
> 
> The mechanic was located by agents of the Municipal Guard the day after the crime. He was arrested in flagrante delicto for larceny, but the criminal framework must change.
> 
> "It was the information that we had at the time, because the victim's car was taken away. But the characteristics of the occurrence are heading towards indictment for homicide, plus theft", said the delegate.
> 
> The mechanic would have said that he used the Onyx to escape the scene and that he had no intention of stealing Sabrina.
> 
> To confirm the version, Buchala asked for Gustavo's telephone confidentiality to be broken.
> 
> "He provided us with the device's password, but I prefer to inspect it after judicial authorization, which should come out today", he said.
> 
> The delegate expects to complete the investigation in the next few days.
> 
> The report sought out the witness to whom Sabrina warned was in danger, but she declined to comment on the case.
