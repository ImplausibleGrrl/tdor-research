> Acey D. Morrison, a 30-year-old Two-Spirit person, was killed in Rapid City, South Dakota on August 21. She is at least the 29th trans or gender-nonconforming American to become a victim of fatal violence this year, per the records of the Human Rights Campaign. 
> 
> As the delayed reporting of Morrison’s death indicates, that figure is likely an undercount; as is the case with too many trans people, reports of Morrison’s death did not make national news because she was misgendered in initial reports. 
> 
> Law enforcement found Morrison dead in a mobile home, after the owner of the residence reported the murder to police, according to local outlets KNBN and KELO. Officials identified a suspect shortly after the shooting and began interviews. It’s unclear whether or not charges have been pressed, despite the fact that the killing occurred nearly a month ago. 
> 
> A heartfelt tribute to Morrison in the local outlet Native Sun News describes her as a “kindhearted, down to earth, joyous, respectful, and loving soul” who was “always there for her family and friends.”
> 
> “Acey always put a smile on others and had those around her laughing and happy,” the obituary reads. “She always had her natural ways in being there for those she loved. She used laughter as medicine and chose self-love to heal wounds. She was the one to open her home up to you, give you her lasts, then inspire you to keep going.”
> 
> The obituary, which referred to Morrison as “our two-spirit relative,” further characterizes her as “authentic, and unapologetic,” and as someone “who strived to succeed.” 
> 
> A transgender pride flag. 
> Dede Ricks, a 33-Year-Old Black Trans Woman, Was Killed in Detroit
> It is the second violent murder of a Black trans woman in Detroit in the span of a month.
> Two-Spirit is a term that refers to someone who encompasses both a masculine and feminine spirit, and is an identity that was coined as an umbrella term for the various gender identities of Indigenous people, according to the Coalition to Stop Violence Against Native Women. 
> 
> Although there is limited data on the experiences of Two-Spirit people specifically, data from the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey (USTS), which remains the largest-scale report on trans Americans’ experiences, suggests that American Indian and Alaska Native trans people experience disproportionately high rates of discrimination and violence. Nearly one in five (19%) of these respondents stated that they had been physically attacked in the past year because of being trans, compared to nine percent of all USTS respondents. A more recent report by the Sovereign Bodies Institute and the California Rural Indian Health Board, released in 2021, found that of a sampling of 18 Native LGBTQ2S+ people, 90% reported experiencing two or more forms of violence.
