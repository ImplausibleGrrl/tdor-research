> The murders do not stop in Ecuador: they find a trans woman shot in the head
> 
> The Quito Trans Psycho Center of the Silhouette X Association, members of the National Platform "New Trans Ecuador Network" (which covers rural, community and periphery areas with its collectives), the GLBTI Observatory, and the National Federation of LGBT Organizations, make public the following fact.
> 
> In Ecuador there is a significant increase in violent deaths against LGBTI people, particularly trans women and men. In less than two months there are already several victims who have been reported, first as missing, to later be found lifeless and with evidence of violence and torture on their bodies.
> 
> This time, the murder occurred in the city of Esmeraldas against a companion who responded to the names of Carolina de Leo Montaño, a 25-year-old trans woman, who lived in the Porto de Limón neighborhood sector in Esmeraldas. Her friends and family informed the Trans Psycho Center of her disappearance on Sunday, September 11, 2022. Local media such as "La Calle Habla", directed by Darío Robinson Rivera, also alerted her.
> 
> On Sunday, Carolina received a call and left for an unknown destination without telling her relatives where she was going; she took the keys to her house so as not to disturb her return. However, she never came back.
> 
> A day later, her family and friends reported that she was found dead by a firearm projectile with an entry and exit hole in her head, execution type. Her body was found in the central market of the city of Esmeraldas.
> 
> The Runa Sipiy Report of the Silhouette X Association, records that, with this fact, there are already 21 murders, transfemicides, violent deaths that are not clarified or suspected of criminality against our populations, at the national level.
> 
> For all the reasons described, we call on the Attorney General of the State, Diana Salazar, the Commander of the Police, Carlos Cabrera, the Undersecretary of Diversities Alexander Guano, the Ombudsman of Ecuador (e), Cesar Córdoba Valverde, to carry out the necessary coordination to find the culprit or culprits, of this fact that once again mourns our community.
