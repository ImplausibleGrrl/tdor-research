Parmignola
Marinella di Sarzana
Liguria
Italy
beaten and shot



> The facts known at the moment are as follows. Two corpses found within two days, of a prostitute and a trans , in a borderland between Liguria and Tuscany, far from the glamor of Versilia. Daniele Bedini, 32, was arrested for the first murder, that of Nevila Pjetri, but he declares himself "completely unrelated to the facts". It is investigated to understand whether the second murder, that of Carlo Bertolotti, known as "Camilla", is also attributable to him.
> 
> The murders of Nevila Pjetri and Carlo Bertolotti
> Let's put the events in order. Nevila Pjetri's body was found in the night between Saturday and last Sunday in Marinella di Sarzana: an autopsy revealed that she was killed by two shots from a .22 caliber pistol after being brutally attacked. The second body, that of Carlo Bertolotti, a transsexual known as Camilla, was found lifeless 48 hours later a few kilometers away, also killed by a firearm. Bertolotti's Fiesta had been found by the carabinieri, alerted by friends and acquaintances who had not seen the victim for a couple of days. It is not excluded that she was already killed between Sunday and Saturday or between Sunday and Monday.
> 
> The owner of a well-known carpentry shop in the area had presented himself to the police station in Carrara to report the theft of a .22 caliber pistol. At dawn yesterday the carabinieri arrested his son: Daniele Bedini, 32 years old. The hypothesis is that he stole his father's gun and committed a double murder with that weapon. Daniele Bedini has a history of robbery, receiving stolen goods, and drugs. On the documents he appears to be a craftsman. Bedini did not admit killing Nevila, stealing her bag and cell phone, and then throwing her into the bed of the Parmignola stream, in Marinella di Sarzana. The weapon regularly held by the father has not yet been found and at the moment it is only compatible with the bullets found next to the corpses. The hearing to validate the arrest is expected in the next few hours.
> 
> All the news today
> Carlo Bertolotti, 43, hairdresser, transsexual known by the name of Camilla, was also killed with a small caliber gun. His car was not far from the body, two compatible shells and bloodstains were found. The points of contact between the first and second murders are there. Impossible to draw hasty conclusions, but one of the hypotheses reported today by the newspapers is that Bedini attacked Nevila, perhaps to rob her, and that Camilla saw something too much and only for what she was murdered. Investigators think that Bedini may have killed a second time, it is not clear how long after the first of her, to eliminate those who had seen him while he was loading in the car - probably to rob her - the woman. About him, the investigators write "numerous serious clues have been collected".
> 
> Carlo Bertolotti was 43 years old. She until last year she lived in Montebello di Ceparana where, for four years, she had owned a well-known hairdressing shop. She lived alone, she had long ago lost her father and mother. Last year she moved to Albiano Magra after her house mysteriously burned down. The villagers had also set up a fundraiser to help her. For some months she had found a job as a hairdresser in a shop in Spezia, but she continued to frequent those "border" streets.
> 
> Daniele Bedini: who is the man stopped
> But who is Daniele Bedini? He often drove his father's white Fiorino, and someone actually saw a white car approach Nevila Pjetri that night. But there are no certainties on this element, because he also had the availability of a gray car from his father. Now Bedini has been taken to prison, blocked for fear that he could repeat the crime. In Carrara Daniele Bedini knows him in many. Some acquaintances say today, interviewed by press and TV reporters, that he was often looking for money for drugs or gambling. Violent ways, hyper-trained physique. Once he broke through the wall of a bar to try to steal the proceeds. Ludopathic, drug addict, violent. "He was out of the tunnel, he was much better" says his legal he. Daniele Bedini firmly rejects any accusation,
> 
> In the meantime, "in relation to the serious events that occurred in Sarzana", for which investigations are underway by the judicial authority, "in order to strengthen the preventive action in the area", the prefect of La Spezia has called for today , in Sarzana at 11:30, an extraordinary session of the Provincial Committee for Public Order and Safety to which all the mayors of the Val di Magra were invited. The double homicide of the streets of prostitution, however, may already have been solved. The report of the theft of the gun owned by Daniele Bedini's father, formalized a few days before the murders by his parent, is the first piece of a domino that could soon frame him.



> Albanian Daily News
> Italian Police have arrested Deniele Bedini, 32 years old, as a suspect in the murder of 35-year-old Albanian Nevila Pjetri, who was found dead on Sunday in the Parmignola riverbed of Sarzara. 
> 
> Italian media suggest that the 32-year-old has a criminal record in the field of theft. He is an artisan from Massa and lives in the Aulla area. 
> 
> Since yesterday morning he has been officially investigated for the death of Neliva Pjetri, whose lifeless body was found in the early hours of Sunday morning by the Parmignola creek in Marinella di Sarzana. 
> 
> Investigators have tracked him down by security cameras, but at the moment these are just suspicions, writes La Reppublicaa. 
> 
> Bedin was interrogated for a long time at the Arma barracks. His lawyer Rinaldo Reboa explained that his client declared himself "completely unrelated to the facts" and added: "The only element that prompted investigators to detain my client is the report of the theft of a weapon owned by Daniele Bedini." 
> 
> But investigators think he may have killed the transsexual, whose lifeless body was found yesterday, not far from where Nevila's body was. 
> 
> According to sources, it is suspected that the 32-year-old killed the transsexual after the latter may have seen him loading Nevila's dead body in the car. Investigators say very serious evidence has been gathered against him. 
> 
> Nevila's lifeless body was found on the night between Saturday and last Sunday. The body of a transsexual was found yesterday. 
> 
> The latter was called Carlo Bertolotti, he was a hairdresser, 43 years old and according to the first information coming from the investigators, he would have been killed in a similar way to those used to kill Nevila, the Albanian woman found dead on the shore of the Parmigliola creek, around 3 km from the place where Bertolott's body was found. Again, but the autopsy will confirm, the victim was killed with a small caliber pistol after being beaten. 
> 
> Autopsy of Nevila Peter 
> 
> The Albanian girl was killed with two shots with a 22 caliber pistol to the head. Forensic doctor Susanna Gamba ascertained the autopsy result. The first shot was fired in the forehead, the other behind the left ear. It remains to be seen whether the killing took place at the place where the body was found or elsewhere.
