> Ventura Crimes: The Murder of Katrina Montgomery
> 
> Katrina Montgomery, photo via LA Times
> Having spent most of my life in Ventura County, I’m always surprised to learn about crimes that made headlines I’d never heard of. The murder of Katrina Montgomery is one of those cases. I stumbled upon the case by accident after discovering a true crime book titled Dangerous Attraction by Robert Scott. I had never heard of Katrina, and it haunts me to think that her body has never been found, ultimately denying many of her loved ones closure now that she is gone.
> 
> The Life of Katrina Montgomery
> Katrina Montgomery was 16 years old in 1989 when she met and began dating a man name Mitch. Mitch had been one of the first members of a white supremacist gang known around Ventura as the Skin Head Dogs (SHD).
> 
> As a young teenager, Katrina would attend SHD events and parties with Mitch, though she would never become a member of the gang. The SHD gangs gained a reputation around Ventura for committing racially motivated crimes and brawling in the street.
> 
> Eventually, Mitch enlisted in the army and was sent to Germany. Katrina followed him for several months. Katrina’s parents expressed unhappiness about her move, but the two had broken up by 1992 and she came back. When Mitch returned to the U.S., he left the SHD. In the meantime, Katrina maintained a friendship with the gang’s members.
> 
> One of those members was Justin Merriman. Justin and Katrina were the same age, but they seemingly did not have a lot in common.
> 
> In the meantime, Katrina moved to Marina Del Rey, more than one hour away. There, she worked as a server while attending Santa Monica College. She had dreams of becoming a professional photographer, and she showed a lot of promise in the arts.
> 
> The Life of Justin Merriman
> Justin Merriman spent much of his formative years in and out of juvenile detention and then state prison — and it wasn’t just for petty crimes. One of his most disturbing crimes was breaking the windows of a Jewish temple, for after which he assaulted a guard while he was incarcerated. By the age of 18, Justin was a felon.
> 
> While Justin was imprisoned, he wrote letters to Katrina. While some of his letters encouraged her to continue dating Mitch, he would also ask her for “neat” pictures. His letters eventually became more sexually explicit.
> 
> Once, Katrina visited Justin in prison and he insinuated he would like to have a sexual relationship with her. Katrina did not seem especially interested, but she remained friendly.
> 
> Justin was released from prison in 1992, and Katrina visited him at the Ventura home he shared with his sister and mother soon afterward. During one visit, Katrina’s friend waited in the truck while she ran in. The friend reported that Katrina emerged from the house with red marks on her neck and claimed she’d been attacked. Another time, Katrina allegedly told her mother that Justin had tried to sexually assault her when she’d been sleeping in a guest room.
> 
> Thanksgiving, 1992
> For Thanksgiving, Katrina planned a celebration with her family and then a gathering in Santa Barbara for the following weekend. Oxnard rests between the two cities, so Katrina was going to stop by an SHD party on the way.
> 
> The party was hosted by the leader of the SHD, Scott Porcho, and his wife, Apryl. Members of another gang, the Sylmar Peckerwood Family, were also in attendance. Justin Merriman was also there.
> 
> Witnesses at the party claimed Katrina and Justin interacted normally at first, even hugging. But Porcho would later claim Justin was angry at Katrina and didn’t want her around. With individuals at the party drinking, several arguments and small fights had sparked within the group.
> 
> One of Justin’s friend, Larry, claimed that Justin made comments about wanting to “get” Katrina. In fact, he allegedly handed Larry a steak knife and insinuated he wanted him to stab her. Larry, just 16 years old, didn’t take any of it seriously.
> 
> Later, Justin tried to kiss Katrina and wrestled her in spite of her insistence that he stop. At one point, the two were yelling at each other. Porcho walked in to a bedroom and saw Katrina in bed holding her stomach while Justin and several gang members stood around her. Today, a lot of confusion surrounding who saw what at the party still exists.
> 
> At about 2 a.m. most people had left, but Porcho and Justin got into a fight. Porcho hit Justin with a beer bottle, and Katrina helped him clean the wound. Still, Justin continued making jokes about killing her. Eventually, Apryl drove Justin and his friends to their home in Ventura.
> 
> When he got home, Justin called Porcho’s house to speak with Katrina. Porcho didn’t want that to happen, but Katrina got the phone anyway. She demanded the keys to her car, and Apryl relented, thinking Katrina was going to drive home to Los Angeles.
> 
> Katrina was actually going to Justin’s house. When she got there, she got into Justin’s bed. His friends, including Larry Nicassio and Ryan Bush, were sleeping on the floor of his room, and they overheard Justin force Katrina into sexual acts. Nobody intervened, claiming they were afraid of Justin.
> 
> Katrina eventually asked to go to the bathroom, but Justin insisted she use a trash can. Nicassio argued with Justin, telling her to let Katrina use the bathroom. When Katrina went to put her clothes on and began tying her shoes, Justin stabbed her and hit her over the head.
> 
> Eventually, Justin and his friends rolled Katrina up in bags and put her body in her own truck. The group drove to Sylmar, about an hour away, and dropped Katrina’s body near a drainage pipe at Sunset Farms. They left her truck at Angeles Crest National Forest, dumped their weapons and Katrina’s belongings in a dumpster, and headed home. They returned a few nights later to remove and rebury Katrina.
> 
> Katrina Is Missing
> It was not long before Katrina’s mother became worried about her daughter’s whereabouts. Katrina’s mother called the police to report her daughter missing.
> 
> Apryl, still believing Katrina had gone home, was alarmed to discover this had not been the case. In fact, Apryl talked to Katrina’s mother on the phone and lied about the last time she’d seen the young woman. Apryl told Katrina’s mother she hadn’t seen the girl in months, but she discovered the lie within a matter of hours.
> 
> The Los Angeles County Sheriff found Katrina’s truck soon. It had been pushed over an embankment. Inside the truck was Katrina’s purse, and the bed of the truck had evidence of blood.
> 
> Investigators received a tip from one of the partygoers from Thanksgiving. The tip pointed the investigation toward Justin’s friends, including Nicassio. When investigators dug, they learn more about the rift between Porcho and Justin, and they also discovered that the men had been talking about what happened. It didn’t seem to be a big secret.
> 
> When police arrived at the Merriman home to talk to Justin, a carpet cleaner was working. But still, leads seemed to go nowhere for a long time.
> 
> Following the Leads
> Five years after Katrina Montgomery went missing, in July of 1997, Apryl met with a prosecutor to discuss the case. By this time, Apryl had divorced Porcho and was living her own life.
> 
> The prosecution struggled to bring forth a case based on the fact that so many people had lied to investigators, which made it nearly impossible to convince a grand jury to bring charges to the table. But months after Apryl talked to prosecutors, Larry Nicassio, Ryan Bush, and Nicassio’s girlfriend were arrested. Nicassio’s girlfriend disclosed statements he made about the murder. Eventually, other members of the SHD began making statements.
> 
> Nicassio and Bush made agreements with the prosecution. They offered information about the location of Katrina’s body and Nicassio also agreed to talk to Justin while wearing a wire. Dismayed investigators realized that the land Nicassio pointed them to had been developed recently, and they would never able to retrieve Katrina.
> 
> In the meantime, Justin had spent the last few years sexually assaulting women. In January 1998, Justin was taken into custody following an hours-long standoff with officers. He’d been riding a bike down Ventura Avenue in Avenue when officers tried to stop him. He pulled out a gun and barricaded himself inside a home nearby. While he was in jail for this encounter, prosecutors charged him in connection with Katrina’s death.
> 
> The Trial
> In 2001, Justin Merriman’s trial began. He maintained complete innocence in Montgomery’s disappearance.
> 
> Justin’s attorneys argued that their client had suffered severe psychological trauma and brain damage, both of which caused him to act with impulsivity and violence.
> 
> Justin was found guilty of first-degree murder, rape, conspiracy, and witness intimidation. He was sentenced to death, a sentence which was upheld in 2014. Today, he is awaiting execution.
> 
> Katrina’s remains have not been found.
