> Saturday, Jonathan Caradonna was stabbed and killed on 13th Ave E — the second man living homeless on the streets around Capitol Hill to be murdered in March.
> 
> Tuesday afternoon, the King County Medical Examiner officially identified the 32-year-old. Cause of death: multiple stab wounds. Manner of death: homicide.
> 
> Seattle Police say Caradonna died Saturday after he was found that morning in an apartment building doorway along the 100 block of 13th Ave E where he staggered and could be heard yelling for assistance after the attack. Police have released no suspect information and announced no arrests. Police were reported checking the area around a nearby 7-11 where a male had been in a possible mental crisis previous to the incident and were also on the search for a greyhound puppy reported missing by the victim.
> 
> Caradonna has been living and struggling with homelessness in Seattle for four years since arriving here from Texas and, before that, Louisiana. He has listed the Compass Housing Alliance facility in Pioneer Square as his home address but also frequented the Capitol Hill library.
> 
> Life in Seattle was a challenge for Caradonna. He was nailed for a litany of traffic infractions including operating a vehicle without a license and insurance upon his arrival in the city. He was also picked up a few months later for trying to shoplift Clorox wipes, travel size items, clothing, and shoes from the downtown Target. “Apprehension was initiated due to merchandise evidence being more than two items and exceeding the $25.00 minimum directive,” the arrest report reads. Caradonna never appeared in court to face the charge and a bench warrant was issued for him that summer.
> 
> “This was my son. Just found out last night. He just turned 32 on Valentine’s day. While he had some issues, this (was) no way to go,” Caradonna’s mother said in a comment posted to CHS. “His young brother, sisters, aunts and stepmom are all mourning. I am sorry your city isn’t the same it was 30 years ago.”
> 
> Caradonna’s life and death is mirrored by the murder of Brent Wood on Capitol Hill earlier this month.
> 
> Wood, 31, also struggled with homelessness and was known in the neighborhood as an artist who mostly survived on the streets and through odd jobs with local businesses. Wood was found beaten to death behind the Broadway Rite Aid early on the morning of Thursday, March 3rd.
> 
> Police have also provided few details in that investigation and have not announced any arrests. There has been some effort to create a reward fund to help solve the murder but those kinds of programs are rarely helpful in serious cases.
> 
> SPD asks anyone with information that might help in either investigation to call the SPD tipline at (206) 233-5000.
