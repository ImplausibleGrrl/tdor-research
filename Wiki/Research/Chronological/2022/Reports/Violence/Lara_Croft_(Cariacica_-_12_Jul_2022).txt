> Also according to Silvania, the daughter had psychiatric problems aggravated by drug use and has already been hospitalized, including compulsorily, on other occasions.
> 
> "He died in a very cowardly way. He never carried a weapon, he never dealt with drug trafficking. I say he was a user, he was sick of using drugs. What they did was cowardice. I don't know who it was but Jesus knows. Justice will be done here on Earth and in the heaven. She was sick. Needing help and not violence. She needed psychological care. I even thought about a judge to compulsorily commit her. I have her psychiatrist's reports. They said that drug use was making her schizophrenic. It was supposed to put her in a recovery clinic," he said.

> 
> "She loved me. A wonderful heart. They were strong, there were many. Why didn't they do the same as they did when they went inside my house to commit her? They could have done the same. They went with a shield, a non-lethal weapon. Why didn't they act that way too? Why didn't they contact me? Why didn't they let the judge know? She was in need of help. She didn't need to lose her life”, said the mother.
