> Yaneth was 22 years old and was murdered on the afternoon of April 3 inside her house located south of the city of Colima, Colima (a Mexican state located on the Pacific coast). According to the report of the local journalist, Roberto Macías, armed men entered her home and due to the bullet wounds, Yaneth "lost her life almost instantly." 
> 
> Likewise, the journalist Marina Rodriguez reported that it was neighbors who called the emergency numbers and after that "elements of the different police forces went immediately to verify the facts." 
> 
> Presentes contacted the Attorney General of the State of Colima to find out if it is already being investigated with a gender perspective and as a femicide since, since 2019, the action protocol on the crime of femicide in that state states that it should be applied "to all women, including trans women: tavestis, transsexuals and transgender”. In addition, since 2020 they have proposed guidelines for officials of Expert Services and Forensic Sciences of the Prosecutor's Office for the care of people in cases involving sexual orientation or gender identity.
> 
> The answer was: “The status of the investigation is reserved. Expert elements are already investigating what happened in Gregorio Torres Quintero (colony where the event took place) and will determine those elements with the victim's relatives."
> 
> In social networks, users condemned the event and linked it to the growing insecurity after the militarization of the state. And it is that the security strategy of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has been to send hundreds of elements of the National Guard, the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Navy.
> 
> According to an analysis by Insight Crime, since 2016 Colima (with less than one million inhabitants) has led the per capita homicide rate in all of Mexico. The increase in this violence is closely linked to being a state considered an "invaluable drug trafficking corridor." 


> This Sunday afternoon, in the Torres Quintero neighborhood, the murder of a trans woman was recorded inside a house, located on avenida Liceo de Varones.
> 
> It was shortly after 4:30 in the afternoon that, according to the first reports, subjects on motorcycles arrived at a house located on avenida Liceo de Varones and shot a trans woman who was inside. They then ran away.
> 
> The injured presented several wounds in different parts of the body, so she died at the scene, due to the seriousness of them.
> 
> The place was cordoned off to remove the body and the corresponding evidence.
