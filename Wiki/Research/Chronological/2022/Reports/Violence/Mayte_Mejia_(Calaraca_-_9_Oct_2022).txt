> 
> The Ombudsman's Office is following up on this case, since the victim had already reported threats against her integrity.
> 
> They offer a reward of up to $20 million for the person responsible for murdering a minor in Transmilenio
> "We want the procedures for these measures to be reviewed so that more attention is paid to the start of the routes and their achievement," said Andrés Buitrago Moncaleano, Secretary of the Government of Armenia.
> 
> Similarly, the official assured that it is "a case that has no connotation of transphobia in the municipality, it has no relationship or correlation with other cases or with other homicides that have occurred."
> 
> The authorities analyze the security cameras located near the crime scene to find the person responsible.




> In the El Bosque de Armenia park sector, the young transgender woman identified as Mayte Mejía was fatally wounded.
> 
> This 28-year-old person was attacked with a knife in events that occurred yesterday, Sunday, in the early hours of the morning at around 4:20 a.m.
> 
> The case was reported to agents of the National Police in Quindío, so units of the CAI located a few meters away quickly came to the scene, who proceeded to help the victim and in an official vehicle transferred her to the hospital in the South.
> 
> There, unfortunately the doctors could not do anything to save her, because the damage to her body was irreversible.
> 
> It was learned that Mayte was a leader of the LGTBI community and that she had received some intimidation due to complaints she made about insecurity problems that are affecting precisely that population.
> 
> Faced with this crime, other leaders lamented the acts of intolerance and violence of which the members of this community have been victims, and demanded a lack of commitment on the part of the authorities to guarantee their rights.
> 
> They mentioned that they have only received accompaniment from the Ombudsman's Office and some support from the departmental Health Secretariat.
