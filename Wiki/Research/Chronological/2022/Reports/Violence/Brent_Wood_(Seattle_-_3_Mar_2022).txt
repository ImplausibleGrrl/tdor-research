> The King County Medical Examiner has identified the man found murdered off E Olive Way behind the Broadway Rite Aid early Thursday morning. Investigators say he was beaten to death.
> 
> The victim has been identified as Brent Wood, 31. According to police reports and court records, Wood did not have a permanent address but received mail at a Compass Housing Alliance facility in Pioneer Square. UPDATE: Friends tell CHS Wood was an artistic man and is being mourned by many in the Capitol Hill community including the small businesses where he would do odd jobs and the fellow artists who got to know him.
> 
> Wood had an “unwavering artistic view of the world around” and “immediate compassion and love for everyone he met,” Naith, a Capitol Hill talent buyer and owner of Bitchin Sits Pet Service tells CHS.
> 
> “He often would be selling his art to support himself and was actively trying to get off the street,” Naith said.
> 
> Wood would also find work doing at neighborhood businesses including Twice Sold Tales.
> 
> “He was troubled but by no means a hardened criminal,” Naith said.
> 
> Life on the streets put Wood in regular contact with law enforcement including in 2018 when he was busted for sleeping in the Seattle Central parking garage off Harvard and Pine. Wood admitted to an officer he was in possession of methamphetamine and was eventually convicted and sentenced to 45 days in King County Jail plus 48 day credit for time served.
> 
> In te charges against him, prosecutors complained that Wood was “unlikely to appear in court in response to a summons” and had accrued multiple “warrants for his arrest issued as a result of his failure to appear on various misdemeanor criminal charges.”
> 
> A recent warrant for Wood was issued over his failure to appear on a theft charge stemming from an incident at a downtown Bartell’s in which police say Wood was chased down with a stolen case of beer.
> 
> While many struggling with homelessness, mental health issues, and addiction on the streets of Seattle came here from somewhere else, Wood had local roots. He registered to vote as an 18-year-old in Kenmore.
> 
> CHS reported here on Thursday morning’s murder investigation as Wood was found dead in a pool of blood near the dumpsters behind the Broadway drugstore. According to the medical investigation, Wood was beaten to death and died of multiple blunt force injuries to his head
