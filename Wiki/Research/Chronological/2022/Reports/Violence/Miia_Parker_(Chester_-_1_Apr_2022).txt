shot



> Her name was Miia Love Parker. Born and raised in Philadelphia, she was a 25-year-old Black trans woman. She was most recently living in Chester, Pennsylvania, a Philly suburb. She studied at Temple University and worked modeling MAC cosmetics.
> 
> According to CBS Philadelphia, Chester police say on April 1, 2022 Friday around 3:30 a.m. Miia Parker, a trans woman was shot while in a vehicle parked on the 1900 block of Chestnut Street. A friend drove her to the hospital where she presumably died.
> 
> While the motive is unknown, local police have identified a suspect, 38-year-old Saad Najeed Dwight. He is considered armed and dangerous. A so-called ‘manhunt’ is underway. Anyone with information is asked to call 911 or contact Chester Police at 610-447-8424
> 
> Miia’s friends describe her as someone who lit up a room when she entered. Her Facebook profiles lists among her likes – the TV show Pose, puppy memes, and lots of shopping and fashion pages.
> 
> Miia is the tenth transgender person reported as a victim of fatal violence in 2022. She is the sixth Black trans woman and the eighth woman of color from these neighbors. At age 25, she is among the eldest of the victims as are under 30 and one was 33 at the times of their deaths. Their deaths come on the heels of 2021, the most violent year in recorded history with the deaths of 57 trans, non-binary, and gender nonconforming people in the United States alone. Note that the tabulation includes a significant number of reports of folx murdered in 2021. This might be confusing. Of course it is confusing. I tried to sort it out below.
> 
> As of now, we have lost one trans neighbor to this terror campaign of fatal violence every 9.8 days.
> 
> Miia’s funeral was scheduled for today. Friends organized a vigil for her this past weekend and have been speaking with the media to share her spirit.
> 
> Rest in power, Miia. You deserved a long and beautiful life. I am so sorry we failed to create a world that would keep you safe. I hope you find peace, Miia. Your friends and loved ones will always celebrate and remember you.
> 
> May your memory be a revolution.




> CHESTER, Pa. (CBS) — A manhunt is underway for a killer in Delaware County. Police are asking for the public’s help.
> 
> Loved ones say the victim was the life of the party. She knew how to light up a room.
> 
> On Wednesday, CBS3 sat down with friends and family who are completely devastated by what they call a senseless homicide. They did not want to go on camera for fear the gunman is still at large.
> 
> They shared a lot about who the victim was and say they want justice to be served.
> 
> Chester police say last Friday around 3:30 a.m. Jamii Parker, a trans woman who identified as Miia, was shot while in a vehicle parked on the 1900 block of Chestnut Street.
> 
> The friend she was with drove her to the hospital. But police say she has not been cooperating with the investigation.
> 
> The motive behind this deadly shooting is still unknown, but police have identified a suspect, 38-year-old Saad Najeed Dwight.
> 
> He is facing charges that include criminal homicide, third-degree murder, and possession of a firearm not to be carried without a license.
> 
> Chester police say Dwight should be considered armed and dangerous. If you see him, do not make contact, but call authorities instead.
