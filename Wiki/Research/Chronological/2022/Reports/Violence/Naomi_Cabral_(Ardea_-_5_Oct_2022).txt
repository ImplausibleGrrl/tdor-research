Naomi Cabral was strangled and suffocated by a client in a hotel in Ardea (Italy) on 5 Oct 2022.

She was 47.



> A 35-year-old Italian citizen accused of the murder of Naomi Cabral, a 48-year-old Argentine transsexual who lived on the coast of Rome, is already in jail. 
> 
> Naomi was strangled in the night between October 4 and 5 in a room at the Hotel Samoa, in Tor San Lorenzo. The two key clues thanks to which the police from the towns of Frascati and Anzio, together with the Velletri prosecutor's office, managed to solve the case were the images from the surveillance video cameras installed in the hotel area and the data from Naomi's cell phone. . 
> 
> The investigators put under magnification especially the people with whom he met in the last hours of life, in addition to his telephone contacts. The local media specified that there are even images of the now detained man entering the hotel with the victim. 
> 
> The case had initially been defined as confusing because Naomi's body showed no signs of physical violence or traces of blood in the room. However, the post-mortem operation revealed that her death was caused by strangulation, and it is believed that it was during an apparent sexual game. 
> 
> Naomi was a sex worker. She was born in the province of Chaco, but for several years she had lived in Italy. According to the investigation, she received her clients in a small apartment of the Samoa Hotel in Tor San Lorenzo, near Torvaianica, on the Roman coast: there she was found dead on October 6 by Claudia, a transsexual, compatriot and neighbor of Naomi .
> 
> Many hours have passed since she was murdered until her friend Claudia knocked uselessly on the door of Naomi's room and found her dead. 
> 
> The entire story that revolves around Naomi, not just its outcome, has a "Pasolinian" background. In this area to the south of the capital there are well-cultivated fields and industrial establishments, as well as a lot of cement and long blocks with low-story apartments.
> 
> Andrea Conocchia is the parish priest of this area squeezed between the seashore and the Pontina, the highway that reaches Rome from the south. The priest proudly recounts his visit to the Merlo-Moreno diocese in Buenos Aires a while ago while receiving PROFILE at the Beata Vergine Immacolata church, at the end of a crowded mass on a working day.
> 
> “Torvaianica has the perfume and colors of the periphery. Here there are good people, very simple, and migrant friends with temporary jobs who during the winter do not know where they live, where they go. There are also pockets of marginality and, on the other hand, the fact that in our territory there have been – and perhaps still are – mafia 'families' is something that everyone knows,” he said. 
> 
> And he continued: “There is a lot of drug running as well as arrests for drug trafficking and usury. Many teenagers have been abandoned to their fate.”
> 
> Andrea never ruled out the possibility that Naomi was the victim of a violent death. "Perhaps that day in that hotel room there was alcohol, drugs (overdose?) Or perhaps the cause of death was due to private sexual performance," she assured. 
> 
> The priest, who is at the forefront of this complex economic and social reality, has long organized meetings of groups of transsexuals with the Pope. Accompanied by the French nun Genevieve Jeanningros, on April 27 Francis received four South American transsexuals from Torvaianica: Naomi was one of them.
> 
> “That was the first of a series of similar initiatives that we managed to organize after the outbreak of the pandemic. It all started when Naomi and other girls showed up one day at the gate of our church and asked us for food: we gave them pasta, tomatoes, flour, vegetables, coffee, sugar. From then on, they told me that they prostituted themselves. Since they couldn't work on the street due to anti-virus measures, they urgently needed help, they couldn't even pay for the rooms where they receive their clients”. 
> 
> But at one point the father had an idea and proposed to them: "You are Argentineans, if you write the history of your living conditions, perhaps the Pope, who is like a parish priest from all over the world, will give you a hand." They sent the letters and approved the help. “Then, he sent us fifty anticovid vaccines in an ambulance, in addition to tests, swabs, food: everything destined for our transsexual community, of which the Pope is a close friend. The meeting we had with the Pope was precisely to thank this help”.
> 
> How did Francisco react after hearing the news of Naomi's death? “Sister Genevieve visited him again recently and brought him a card with a picture of Naomi from our meeting with him. Francis thanked her for her gesture and commented that he will be able to pray and remember her that way.”
> 
>  
> 
> “I was naked, face down, in bed”
> 
> Naomi did not answer calls or messages. They hadn't seen her for a few days and that caught the attention of her friends and members of the trans community. It was Claudia, a native of Jujuy, who found her dead. 
> 
> “A colleague told me that she hadn't seen her for two days and that she hadn't answered the phone, a fact that caught my attention. So I contacted her on WhatsApp and nothing. I called her landline and the same thing, it was turned off. That's when I went up to her little apartment – ​​a bed, a television, a kitchen and a tiny room – and I knocked on the door, I told her: 'Naomi, open it, it's me, Claudia.' I knocked harder and the door opened, it wasn't locked: that's when I saw her, imagine how I felt. She was naked, face down, on the bed. I saw everything from the outside, I did not touch her or enter the apartment, ”she told PROFILE. 
> 
> And he recalled: “We have shared beautiful moments because we live in the same place. And she always told me: 'Never make me sick, my old lady, because in that case, who is going to take care of me...'. We are all trans, we are a union. What do I want now? May Naomi have a good burial."
