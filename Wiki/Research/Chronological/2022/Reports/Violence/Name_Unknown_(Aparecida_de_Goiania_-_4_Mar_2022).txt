A transvestite was found dead at dawn this Friday (04), in Vila Nossa Senhora de Lourdes, in Aparecida de Goiânia.

The victim's body was lying on a vacant lot, in a motel region, and had injuries on the neck, skirt at the navel, exposed private parts and next to a wig.

Witness reports to the Military Police say she was last seen leaving with a motorcyclist around 1 am.

The site was cordoned off as soon as the military arrived. The Civil Police and the Scientific Police were also notified of the situation to initiate investigations and expertise, respectively.
