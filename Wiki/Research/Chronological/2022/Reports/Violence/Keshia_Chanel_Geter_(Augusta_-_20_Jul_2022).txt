> Trans woman murdered in Augusta, GA
> 
> Officers were called to the Augusta hotel for a possible homicide on Wednesday July 20, 2022 for a possible homicide. Officers arrived at the Knights Inn in Augusta, GA around 10:28am to find 26 year old Keshia Chanel Geter of Eastover S.C. who identified as a Black trans woman.
> 
> 
> Investigators say that she was traveling with a friend and was found with at least one fatal gunshot wound and was pronounced dead by the coroner’s office at 11am. 
> 
> Sadly due to multiple local media outlets misgendering, deadmaming her and posting male pictures although she presented as female. Sadly these action usually cause us to miss these murders which is why we say at least because many go under the radar. 
> 
> Keshia is at least the 21st murder of a trans person according to HRC website following the murder of Kitty Monroe of Chicago Illinois.
> 
> She is at least the 14th Black trans woman this year. 
> 
> She is at least the second Black trans woman murdered in the area following the murder of Felycya Harris murdered in Meadowbrook Park, GA on October 3, 2020 and Jerrome Miller was charged for her murder.
> 
> It’s believed that she and the female friend traveled together often but that’s really all we got from investigators and have no clue if the friend is CIS or Trans. They also noted that the region has been dealing with an outbreak of fatal shootings and suspicious deaths since April and the sheriff vowed “decisive” action including gang crackdowns, roadblock checkpoints and use of high-tech surveillance cameras in targeted areas.
> 
> This is still an active investigation so additional details are limited. Our hope at TransGriot is that we get #JusticeForKeshia 
> 
> Anyone that may have information that could lead to an arrest in this murder is urged to contact the local sheriff’s office.
> 
> Also special thank you to those that tag us or inbox us to notify us of possible trans murders and to the family friends and local community we are TransGriot send our love and support.
