Cypress Ramos was found dead in Lubbock, Texas (USA) on 13 Feb 2022.

She was 21.


> Cypress Ramos was a 21-year-old Latina transgender woman who was loved in her local LGBTQ+ community. Her friend Camilla Urbina said that Ramos supported her drag performances and described a video that Ramos took of one of her performances: “Now that I have a video that she does have, that was from her hands, it just means so much more. I think, if anything, I could say like that was my number one fan.”
> 
> On February 13, 2022, Ramos was found dead in Lubbock, Texas. Ramos’ death is at least the third violent killing of a transgender or gender non-conforming person in 2022. We say “at least” because too often these deaths go unreported — or misreported. In 2021, despite limitations in reporting, HRC officially recorded the largest number of fatal trans violence incidents for a second consecutive year since we began tracking this violence in 2013.
> 
> Cypress Ramos’ death was an awful end to such a young life. Her story highlights how trans women of color are still devalued in our society. We must all work to end the epidemic of violence against transgender and non-binary people. May justice be served in this case.”



> LUBBOCK, Texas (KCBD) - Cypress Ramos’ friends are demanding justice, after the 21-year-old’s body was found in a storage unit Saturday. The murder warrant for 32-year-old Allan Montemayor reveals information about the death. The warrant says Cypress died after being struck with a hard object. Police records show that Montemayor says he believed a song told him to kill Cypress but also believed that Cypress heard a song with instructions to kill Montemayor.
> 
> Cypress’ friend, Camilla Urbina, isn’t buying Montemayor’s story and wants justice.
> 
> “He tried to burn my friend, literally. Like burn, burn them up,” Camilla said.
> 
> Police say security camera video captured Montemayor’s truck at the storage unit near the 2700 block of North Frankford Ave. on Saturday. He and someone else entered the storage unit, but an hour and 20 minutes later, he came out alone and drove off. Investigators tracked him down and say they found blood on his legs.
> 
> “And there was blood on his pants, I believe that something else happened. And the truth will come out. And you will pay, promise,” Camilla said.
> 
> Montemayor told police he had been in the bathroom and when he came out he saw Cypress had set a fire. He then said Cypress “came at him with a bat...and it was either me or him.”
> 
> Camilla doesn’t believe that’s what happened.
> 
> “She is not that strong to even hit a person with a crowbar or a four-by-four or whatever it was that hit him when he was out of the restroom. There’s no way.”
> 
> Camilla says Cypress identified as a female and had for as long as she knew her. Camilla is a drag performer in Lubbock and says Cypress was always supportive and well known and loved in the gay community. At one point, Cypress sent Camilla a video of her performance.
> 
> “Now that I have a video that she does have, that was from her hands, it just means so much more. I think, if anything, I could say like that was my number one fan.”
> 
> Camilla says she will miss Cypress’ smile, something she doesn’t want Montemayor to take from anyone else.
> 
> “I don’t want him to ever get out, ever. I don’t wish death on anybody. And I don’t wish death on him, but I don’t ever want him to get out and hurt anybody else.”
> 
> Montemayor is in the Lubbock County Detention Center held on a $500,000 bond for a charge of murder. The Lubbock Fire Rescue investigators and Fire Marshal say the fire is classified as criminal and the investigation is ongoing.


> Cypress Ramos, a 21-year-old Latina trans woman, was found dead on February 13, 2022 in her hometown of Lubbock, Texas. Cypress died from blunt force trauma. Her suspect was quickly identified as 32 year-old Allan Montemayor and has been arrested and faces a murder charge. Her body was found inside a storage locker in a burning building.
> 
> Cypress attended Coronado High School, but did not graduate. According to her social media profiles, she was a fan of Megan Thee Stallion, creative makeup, and spending time with her friends – she was a “social butterfly” according to multiple people.
> 
> Her family held a vigil for her on February 20 a few days after her burial.
> 
> Cypress is the fourth transgender person reported as a victim of fatal violence in 2022. She is the fourth trans woman of color and the first Latina. All four victims are 25 and under. Their deaths come on the heels of the most violent year in recorded history with the deaths of 55 trans, non-binary, and gender nonconforming people in the United States alone. Note that the tabulation includes a significant number of reports of folx murdered in 2021. This might be confusing. Of course it is confusing.
> 
> I think it is important to note that many law departments are too quick to dismiss interpersonal violence as “not a hate crime” as if the disproportionate focus on men killing women is not grounded in misogynistic hate. I understand there is a legal distinction, but let’s not kid ourselves about the misogyny at the core of so much transphobic violence (not all.) Dismissing the complicated nuances is a disservice to all trans folks. And all women.
> 
> Rest in power, Cypress. You deserved a full life filled with wondrous experiences and so much joy. You died too young and I’m so sorry we didn’t protect you. I hope your reunion with your loved ones is a comfort and that your survivors find solace. And that there is justice for you!



> Transgender woman and drag performer Cypress Ramos was found dead in a storage unit in Lubbock, Texas, this month, and a suspect has been charged with murder.
> 
> Ramos, 21, “died after being struck with a hard object,” TV station KCBD reports. Her body was found February 12.
> 
> A security camera recorded Allen Montemayor, 32, entering the storage unit that day with another person and coming out alone. Police tracked him down and saw that he had blood on his legs, and they arrested him.
> 
> He said he had come out of a restroom and saw that Ramos had set a fire. He said she then attempted to hit him with a baseball bat and that he struck her in self-defense. He further claimed that he had heard a song telling him to kill Ramos and believed she heard a song telling her to kill him.
> 
> Camilla Urbina, a friend of Ramos’s, told KCBD she didn’t believe Montemayor acted in self-defense. “She is not that strong to even hit a person with a crowbar or a four-by-four or whatever it was that hit him when he was out of the restroom,” Urbina said of Ramos. “There’s no way.” She also alleged that Montemayor had set the fire. “He tried to burn my friend, literally,” she said.
> 
> Montemayor is charged with murder and is being held at the Lubbock County Detention Center.
> 
> Ramos was well-loved in the Lubbock LGBTQ+ community, said Urbina, who has a video of one of Ramos’s performances that she treasures. “Now that I have a video that she does have, that was from her hands, it just means so much more,” Urbina said.
> 
> Ramos is the third trans American known to have died by violence in 2022, after 2021 saw a record total of 56 such deaths reported. The total for any given year is likely higher, as many victims are deadnamed and misgendered, or their deaths not reported at all.
> 
> “Cypress Ramos’ death was an awful end to such a young life,” Tori Cooper, the Human Rights Campaign’s director of community engagement for its Transgender Justice Initiative, said in a press release. “Her story highlights how trans women of color are still devalued in our society. We must all work to end the epidemic of violence against transgender and nonbinary people. May justice be served in this case.”
