> ...
> On Wednesday evening, Juraj K. was waiting in front of the Tepláren. He executed Matúš Horváth and Juraj Vankulic in cold blood with his father’s pistol and seriously injured a young woman."





> Matúš Horváth was 23 years old and has been studying Chinese again at the Comenius University in Bratislava since September. In the summer of 2023 he wanted to do his bachelor’s degree. Orphaned, he came from a poor background and earned his money in Tepláren, the only queer bar in the Slovakian capital. He loved comics and anime and volunteered to help prepare for the annual fan convention.

> Juraj Vankulic was 27, non-binary, from Žilina in the northwest of the country and had been working as a visual merchandiser for a famous fashion brand for more than five years.
> 
> Juraj Vankulic loved dance and music, and the creative outfits became legendary in the gay community. Every day Juraj Vankulic visited the Tepláren, the safe place and important Safe Space at Zámocká 30 (Castle Street) not far from the Bratislava Castle on the left bank of the Danube.
> 
> The author
> Michal Hvorecky (45) is a journalist and writer. He lives in Bratislava and has published five novels, two collections of short stories and one collection of essays.
> 
> Juraj K. was 19 years old and attended an elite school for talented students in the Slovakian capital of Bratislava. His English was accent-free and he took part in many class competitions.
> 
> But in the last two or three years, the teachers have noticed that the lonely boy has changed, as is now being described. He reacted aggressively to criticism, he had few friends, and instead of spending time with his peers, he was spending more and more time on the unregulated discussion forums 4chan, 8chan and Telegram. The relaxed rules enable right-wing extremists to exchange ideas and disseminate particularly radical and misanthropic content.
> 
> A 65-page manifesto from the perpetrator
> The teachers tried to get in touch with Juraj’s parents several times and offered help and psychological counselling, without success. No wonder, since Juraj’s father was a candidate for the Slovak parliament on the list of the neo-fascist party Vlast (Homeland), and several family members regularly shared far-right messages on social media.

> Juraj K. wrote a 65-page, barely legible manifesto entitled “Call to Arms”. He mixed anti-Semitic, homophobic and xenophobic motives with abstruse conspiracy theories. Humanity, according to Juraj K., finds itself in an existential struggle of unprecedented importance to defend the traditional values ??of nation, state, religion and family in order to prevent demographic decline, moral decomposition and political disintegration.
> 
> He threatened a new Holocaust. He admired Brenton Tarrant, who attacked mosques in New Zealand, and John Earnest, who attacked the synagogue in Poway, California. Both Tarrant and Earnest wrote similar manifestos.
> 
> On Tuesday, October 11, 2022, Juraj K. wrote that he had already made up his mind. He wants to change the old world that has so disappointed him with his own hands. At the time, he only had a single follower on Twitter.
> 
> On Wednesday evening, Juraj K. was waiting in front of the Tepláren. He executed Matúš Horváth and Juraj Vankulic in cold blood with his father’s pistol and seriously injured a young woman. Eight shots were fired. Matúš Horváth and Juraj Vankulic had just chatted and had a lemonade together.
> 
> The killer posted the first message of his attack on Twitter at 7:39 p.m. Ten minutes later, Slovak police reported the brutal shooting on Facebook: An unprecedented act of terrorism in Bratislava!
> 
> Juraj K. documented the double murder on social media with photos and short messages (the accounts were later deleted). The police were already looking for him. A helicopter was also used in the hunt. “The cops are probably incompetent,” the attacker sneered on his Twitter account five hours after the crime. Juraj K. also indirectly claimed responsibility for the attack. “I have no regrets, isn’t that funny?” he asked.
> 
> In the next post he added the hashtags gaybar, Bratislava and HateCrime. In the early morning, the perpetrator, who also wanted to attack the Jewish community and murder the prime minister, turned the gun on himself.
