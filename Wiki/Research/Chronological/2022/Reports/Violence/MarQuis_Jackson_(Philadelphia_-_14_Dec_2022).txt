> A Black transgender man was found dead in Philadelphia last week, having apparently suffered blunt force trauma to his head.
> 
> The body of Mar’Quis “MJ” Jackson was discovered Wednesday in the backyard of a home in Philadelphia’s Nicetown neighborhood, Pittsburgh Lesbian Correspondents reports. He hadn’t come home two days earlier, December 12, which was his 33rd birthday. His mother called several of his friends and acquaintances, and she eventually reached the occupant of the residence where his body was found. His remains may have been in the yard for the entire two days.
> 
> The police have categorized his death as a homicide and are continuing to investigate. Friends said one suspect was detained but released because there was insufficient evidence, according to Pittsburgh Lesbian Correspondents.
> 
> His friend Sharree Harvey said Jackson was “full of life and love” and “would get the party started anywhere,” the site reports. She has set up a GoFundMe campaign to help with Jackson’s funeral expenses.
> 
> Jackson grew up in South Carolina. He was a supporter of many LGBTQ+ organizations, including the William Way Community Center in Philadelphia and the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund.
> 
> Anyone with information that could be useful in the investigation is asked to call or text (215) 686-TIPS or submit a tip online. Tips can be offered anonymously.
> 
> Jackson is at least the 38th trans, nonbinary, or gender-nonconforming person to die by violence in the U.S. this year. That total includes a trans man and a trans woman killed in the shooting at Club Q in Colorado Springs November 19 as well as a trans woman, whose name has not been released, who was killed in Vallejo, Calif., last month. That is most likely an undercount, as many of these deaths go unreported or misreported, with victims deadnamed and misgendered. The nation saw a record 57 confirmed violent deaths among this population last year.

> 
> Rest in power, Mar’Quis. You deserved to celebrate many more birthdays with your friends and family. You deserved more respect in death than these folx gave you. I hope knowing your mother was looking for you gives you peace. I am sorry we failed to create a safer world for you.
> 
> May your memory be a revolution.
