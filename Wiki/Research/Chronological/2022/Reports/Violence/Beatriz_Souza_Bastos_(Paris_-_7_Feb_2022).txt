forced overdose


Beatriz Souza/Beatriz Bastos was found dead inside an apartment in Paris (France) on 7 Feb 2022. It is alleged that she suffered a forced overdose at the hands of her ex-partner.

She was 38.



A transgender woman from Pará was found dead inside an apartment, in the early hours of Monday (7), in Paris , France . According to information passed on by the victim's family, identified as Beatriz Souza, 38, the suspicion is that the ex-partner has put illegal substances in her drink, causing an overdose .

The main suspect would still have recorded videos of Beatriz dying inside the apartment. “There are several versions. But what most people believe is that they put prohibited substances in her drink. And Pietra (ex-partner) filmed everything, saw her dying and was mocking. It didn't help at all. We just want her to be remembered and justice to be done,” a cousin of Beatriz, who preferred not to be identified, told the report.

Beatriz grew up in the Cremação neighborhood of Belém . Her cousin did not know whether the family intends to bring the body to Brazil. “We spoke very little to each other. But she told her mother that if something ever happened, she didn't want her body brought here,” she said.

Also according to the boy, Beatriz's ex-partner is already in prison. The family tries to contact the French police, looking for information on how to proceed with the case.

Not even the ups and downs of life prevented Beatriz Bastos from fulfilling her dream of returning to Europe. So she did when, in August of last year, she packed her bags and left for France, the country known for its fine wines and sophisticated cuisine, leaving her family behind in the Cremação neighborhood, in the capital of Pará.

At the age of 38, however, the countless dreams she still had were interrupted after she was found dead in her ex-partner's apartment in France. The news shook family members, who were informed on Tuesday morning (8). “There's a lot of things wrong with this story, it's all so strange”, tells a close friend of Beatriz's to DOL tonight.

Over the phone, he recalls that videos and photos showed Bea dying, struggling on the floor and asking for help inside the apartment, which appeared to be broken, “with signs of a physical struggle”, he suggests.

The records were authored by the victim's ex-partner and were sent by him to a third person, who was the one who informed the Pará woman's family about the situation and called the French police, who detained Beatriz's ex. The case, however, remains unclear.

The family tries to establish contact with the French Consulate in search of more answers and help to bring the body of the woman from Pará back to Belém, while also awaiting the results of the autopsy.

In the early hours of Monday, 7th, a transgender woman from Belém do Pará was found dead inside an apartment in Paris, France. According to information shared through messaging apps and other social networks, by friends and relatives of the victim identified as Beatriz Souza, 38, it is believed that she had an overdose caused by her ex-partner.

Some of Beatriz's friends left messages of condolence on Facebook about the victim who lived in the Cremação neighborhood. "You will be greatly missed. Go in peace, cousin," wrote a young man on his Facebook profile. Another friend of Beatriz's said: "I was simply floored (...) God knows what he does, you will always be remembered".

Through social media, friends from Pará ask for justice and say that the suspect would have recorded a video of the victim struggling during the outbreak, shared and denied help to Pará.

There is still no information about what really happened to Beatriz, only that the suspect would have already been arrested. Her identity has not been released.
