> The attack occurred at dawn on Monday, October 17, in a pension located in the town of General San Mart√≠n. According to testimonies, Brenda was next to who is now charged with "attempted murder." There was a fire in the place and it spread to the mattress where she was resting, burning 70% of her body.
> 
> The case that investigates the fact is carried out by the prosecutor Carlos Insaurralde of the Fiscal Instruction Unit No. 3 of San Mart√≠n. Within this framework, the arrest of Carlos Esp√≠ndola was carried out.
> 
> As reported by the district municipality, San Mart√≠n has the largest transvestite-trans population in the entire province. In turn, the El Teje network has been organizing and denouncing police harassment as different acts of violence that they experience daily. On October 21, they mobilized to Route 8 and Avenida Marquez to publicize the brutal attack suffered by Brenda.
> 
> The structural inequality to which LGTBI people and sexual dissidents are subjected, and the lack of public policies, are a constant throughout the country. Although the local Deliberative Council, in June 2018, approved Law 14,783 that stipulates job quotas in the public administration of the province of Buenos Aires for transvestites, transsexuals and transgender people, they are not enough and in many cases the population resorts to prostitution as a way of subsisting. We must continue fighting, since the laws conquered so far, such as gender identity and equal marriage, still do not guarantee equality in life.

> Buenos Aires, Argentina. Brenda, a trans woman and migrant sex worker from the Buenos Aires town of San Mart√≠n, is hospitalized with around 70% of her body burned after an event that is still being investigated. Activism demands that it be treated as a hate crime and stresses that "sex workers are in danger" in that district. So far there is one detainee, Carlos Esp√≠ndola, whom activists in the area identified as a pimp.
> 
> The attack occurred on Monday, October 17, at dawn in a pension where the accused, Brenda and another trans person were. According to sources from the Public Prosecutor's Office to Presentes, there was a fight and fire at the scene. The fire spread to the mattress where Brenda was resting.
> 
> The cause that investigates the fact is carried out by the prosecutor Carlos Insaurralde of the Fiscal Unit of Instruction No. 3 of San Mart√≠n . He does it under the cover of "attempted homicide". Within this framework, the arrest of Carlos Esp√≠ndola was carried out.
> 
> Brenda is a 27-year-old migrant trans woman. She came from Paraguay and is dedicated to sex work in the area of ??Route 8 and M√°rquez de San Mart√≠n. Her situation is one of extreme vulnerability and she was homeless. She is currently admitted to the Eva Per√≥n Hospital in San Mart√≠n in intensive care with about 70% of her body burned.

> Concentration of sex workers and activists at the roundabout of Route 8 and M√°rquez, San Mart√≠n
> Burnt clothes on route 8
> ‚ÄúThe official version says that it was in a boarding house, but there is also another version that the violence starts on Route 8. We actually found clothes and things burned in that area,‚Äù Guille Castro from El Teje de San Mart√≠n told Presentes . a network of solidarity and transvestite care from San Mart√≠n.
> 
> ‚Äú This is transphobia, it is a hate crime‚Äù, added Paola Acevedo, coordinator and referent of El Teje de San Mart√≠n, in dialogue with this agency. About the accused, she said: ‚ÄúWe have run it, the guy wanted to cut off his companions. He and many other pimps and police officers have a problem there with trans because we are empowered and we know our rights.‚Äù She also detailed that "he had already threatened her and hit her: That same night she hit a trans classmate, Marimar, to get her out of the corner."

> Concentration of sex workers and activists at the roundabout of Route 8 and M√°rquez, San Mart√≠n
> ‚ÄúWe see ourselves violated by the police‚Äù
> Acevedo stressed that the situation of sex workers in the area of ??Route 8 and M√°rquez, located between the district of San Mart√≠n and Tres de Febrero, is "critical." Under the slogans "We are in danger" and "The State is responsible", last Friday a group of activists, workers and neighbors gathered at noon in that roundabout. 
> 
> ‚ÄúThere is a white-collar police who are criminals who bribe, stigmatize and criminalize fellow sex workers who engage in sex work. We are violated by the provincial and municipal police who make their petty cash with us. This happened with that of other colleagues such as M√≥nica, Marimar, Brenda and many others, who remain invisible, ‚Äùsaid the coordinator of the diversity office at Fleming Hospital.
> 
> ‚ÄúNo solo nos cobran coimas a nosotras o a nuestros clientes, sino que adem√°s nos intimida, amenazan, golpean y cuando sucede alguna situaci√≥n de violencia contra nosotras son parte o miran para otro lado‚Äù, dice el comunicado de El Teje de San Mart√≠n que circul√≥ para convocar a la concentraci√≥n.
> 
> 
> ¬´Nosotras de encontramos ropas y cosas quemadas en esa zona‚Äù, dicen compa√±eras de Brenda, desmintiendo la versi√≥n oficial
> Cr√≠menes invisibles
> Regarding the violence against sex workers, Acevedo said that four months ago they had the news of the crime of another partner. ‚ÄúM√≥nica is a colleague who worked for more than 20 years in the area. She was picked up on Route 8 and M√°rquez, on the same corner where Brenda worked, and they cut her throat. We found out a month later. She was 42 years old, a native of Tres de Febrero,‚Äù she said.
> 
> ‚ÄúWe highlight machismo, hate crime. That is what an absent State leaves us. We want to be respected, for the police to do their job, not for them to rob or stigmatize us,‚Äù he concluded.
