> November 25, 2022
> Carabobo.- Omar Enrique Bencomo Pineda , a 24-year-old sex worker , was wearing a suit with a tight skirt, heels and a yellow wig on a corner of avenida Lara in Valencia, crossing calle Boyacá, when a motorized vehicle accompanied by a lady came up calling him by his transsexual nickname. It was 11:30 on a Wednesday night.
> 
> Bencomo recognized the voice and approached the vehicle without getting off the sidewalk. After greeting, he had a random conversation with his acquaintance who, in a surprise action, pointed a firearm at him. His interlocutor brushed the muzzle of the gun against his chest and pulled the trigger.
> 
> The bullet pierced right through the heart . He barely gave her a chance to walk a few steps through the sanctums of closed premises before collapsing. The last thing he saw was his friend's motorcycle disappearing over the horizon of the avenue.
> 
> Some driver who was traveling through the well-known road would have seen the body on the ground and notified the authorities. It was midnight when the officials of the Scientific, Penal and Criminal Investigation Corps (Cicpc) arrived at the crime scene, photographed the inert body with the hole in the chest, took the respective samples and lifted the deceased to transfer him to the morgue in the Dr. Enrique Tejera Hospital City (CHET) , where he would be evaluated by forensics.
> 
> In conversations with relatives of the deceased, it was learned that the young man lived alone in his late mother's house in La Candelaria, near the old La Concha service station. He made a living prostituting himself at night with a group of friends, also transsexuals .
> 
> The main suspect in the murder would be a subject not yet identified, with whom the victim had had a business transaction. “My brother charged him some money that he owed him, because he had sold him some wigs. But he was tired of being charged and we believe that he killed him so as not to pay him ,” said Heros Pineda, Bencomo's maternal sister.
> 
> This Thursday morning, the detectives returned to Lara Avenue to try to access the videos from the security cameras of the shops in the area, for which it is presumed that they are already about to identify the motorist and his companion.
> 
> Officials do not rule out that it could have been the revenge of one of Omar Enrique's clients. This theory is also supported by the soñaras that sell coffee and cigarettes right on the corner where the event occurred. “When I arrived in the morning, I saw blood on the floor and part of the wall. There are several drops on the sidewalk. We believe it could have been one of the guys he was sleeping with, because he and his group were known for scamming and stealing his clients, ”commented the woman who preferred not to identify herself.
> 
> The bloodhounds of the Cicpc Homicide Investigation Division remain in the investigations to clarify the case.
