> “It is so sad to find out that another trans sister in Houston was murdered due to transphobia and hate against our trans community, without protection or answers from law enforcement in Houston,” Chino told the Chronicle. “Ni una mas (not one more). We are tired of this happening again and again to our trans sisters.”
> 
> At a time when legislative violence against trans people is steadily increasing, and Texas leads the charge, Castro is at least the third trans person to be killed in the Lone Star State this year. In February, 21-year-old Cypress Ramos was found dead in the Northwest city of Lubbock; that same month, 29-year-old Paloma Vazquez was shot in Houston.
