But on Friday, it should be about taking our emotions to the public. How that affects us as people, and how our everyday life is changed by something like this.
> 
> "It's already well known that after the CSD festival, a young transman was knocked unconscious because he tried stopping anti-queer remarks from being made," the series of images comprising the statement read.
