> MORRISTOWN, Vt. (WCAX) - The arraignment of a man charged in a fatal Morristown stabbing is expected Thursday in Hyde Park.
> 
> Seth Brunell, 43, has been charged with second-degree murder in the stabbing death of Fern Feather, 29, of Hinesburg. Brunell appeared in court in Hyde Park Wednesday but did not offer a plea and the hearing was held for 24 hours.
> 
> Justin Greaves says he has known Feather for many years. Feather recently came out as a transgender woman but at the time of our interview, Greaves was not aware of that and refers to Feather as “he.”
> 
> “Such a kind person. He was always there for you. He always wanted to talk to you if you had any problems. He was going to be an ear for you and he was a very loving person,” Greaves said.
> 
> According to court documents, Brunell spent several days with Feather and claimed Feather made a sexual advance on him before attacking him. Brunell says he then stabbed Feather in self-defense. However, police say Brunell was not injured and there was no evidence of the attack. Now, the state wants Brunell to serve life behind bars.
> 
> “The community is outraged and devasted by this violent act. We are lucky we have some of the best law enforcement in the country and we are not used to seeing this kind of violence in our area but we will pursue it fully and make sure justice is served,” said Lamoille County Deputy State’s Attorney Aliena Gerhard.
> 
> Greaves says that Feather was always just trying to do the best for people and also loved taking care of animals. He says people need to continue to take care of each other in Feather’s absence. “I think that that’s what everyone needs to take away, because we need to have a better sense of community and just being there for each other. If someone has a problem, give them a hand,” Greaves said.
> 
> Governor Phil Scott Tuesday evening issued a statement about the case:
> 
> “Across the country, we have seen disturbing hostility towards the transgender community. Unfortunately, recent events show we are not immune to this in Vermont, and we must commit to continuing our work to make Vermont a more inclusive and welcoming place. Exploiting fear and targeting divisive rhetoric at people who are just trying to be who they are is hateful and can lead to violence.
> 
> “I ask Vermonters to do their part to ensure everyone feels safe in our state and to engage in these conversations from a place of empathy and understanding. Legitimate policy debates can and should be had and should be fact-based and respectful. Sadly, data shows transgender people are more likely to be victims of violence and die by suicide so it’s important to realize ‘how’ we discuss these issues matters.
> 
> “To Vermonters in the LGBTQA+ community, I want you to know we stand with you and support you but know we have more work to do.”
> 
> The state’s attorney’s office says that support services will be available for the many friends of Feather who are grieving.




> The body of 29-year-old Fern Feather, a white trans woman was discovered on Tuesday morning on the side of Duhamel Road near Cadys Falls Road in Morristown, Vermont. The autopsy determined the cause of death was a stab wound to the chest, and the manner of death was homicide. She is the 12th US victim of the campaign of terror traumatizing the trans community in the nation and around the world.
> 
> The suspect Seth Brunell, 43 is in police custody. He was sighted by police with Fern in a vehicle just a few hours before her body was discovered, according to Patch.com (Link includes deadnaming and misgendering.) Brunell is claiming self-defense, but police say there is no physical evidence to support that allegation.
> 
> Fern’s friends are overwhelmingly shocked, commenting on their gentle nature and kind heart. A co-worker posted
> 
> Fern was part of my sweet, weird, fun-loving Salt Café family. We dressed however we wanted — Fern in flowey garb with feathers in their hair; William in skirts and a squirrel tail — and served the Vermontiest farm-to-table food to politicians, farmers, New York Times journalists, culinary school kids, lawyers, the singer Jewel’s mom, visitors from Australia, and so on.
> 
> Fern was the best at making citrus plates: they’d form mandalas of the fruit slices — in a different formation every time — for customers to add to their glasses of ice water.
> 
> For one menu, Fern “invented” mushroom-stuffed-mushrooms, and was delighted when it was the week’s most popular item.
> 
> Then-governor Shumlin was a regular at Salt, and Fern was always so tickled when Peter recognized them on the streets of Montpelier, and greeted them with a shout and a wave. “The *governor* said hello to me today,” they’d report upon showing up for work.
> 
> Suzanne P.
> Fern had lived an adventurous life, traveling around the country, and recently announcing her transition in late March. Just a few weeks ago.
> 
> It’s time to tell the world I’m a Hot Trans Woman in a currently male Hot Body Suit !! dang sure took long enough eh ?! Please share this to liberate our other beautiful ones !
> 
> Born in Montpelier, Vermont, Fern graduated from Lake Region Unified High School District 24 and worked at Salt Cafe. Her Facebook page is overflowing with nature-themed photos, memes, and posts. Clearly, she was deeply connected to the natural world. It was easy for this blogger to get lost in her timeline amidst the many amazing images.

> The Pride Center of Vermont plans to host a space for community to come together and mourn; more information to follow shortly. In the meantime, SafeSpace advocates are available to support at (802) 863-0003 or via the anonymous chatline https://www.pridecentervt.org/safespace/”

> Fern Feather, universally adored by everyone who knew her, was taken from us Tuesday morning by a transphobic man who had recently wormed his way into her life and gained her trust.Local news outlets have begun coverage, predictably deadnaming and misgendering her, as well as universally avoiding the phrase “Hate Crime”. We urge you to submit corrections wherever relevant, especially if you’re an ally. Links to offending articles will be posted in the comments of this post (and we urge you to add any that you find)Her suspected killer, Seth Brunell, has attempted to exploit the age-old transmisogynistic spectre of sexual aggressiveness to wriggle out of taking responsibility for his brutal actions. The evidence does not support his claims, but it doesn’t have to: His claims fit the narrative creeping across our state, our nation, and our world, and as such will be a suitable excuse in the eyes of many,

> I admire Fern’s friends and comrades for vehemently defending her and calling truth to power on the hate underlying her murder and the alleged defense by the murderer. I admire them for tackling the media outlets dead naming and misgendering Fern. I am sad that they must add this task to their grieving process, but appreciate that they do so. Just a few weeks ago, I wrote about the filicide of 19-year-old Kathryn Newhouse whose narrative was controlled by family who described her murder as a mercy-killing because of her disabilities. Her friends didn’t even know she had died and were unable to immediately respond to those narratives, but they have since taken control of the narrative.

> What I read above sounds to me like grooming, earning her trust and then killing her when she was vulnerable. It was deliberate and vicious. These are the crimes we must center when we repudiate hateful rightwing rhetoric about LGBTQ grooming. Our most at-risk community members require all of us to ramp up our resistance.

> Fern is the 12th transgender person reported as a victim of fatal violence in 2022. She is the first white trans woman reported murdered in 2021 that we know of so far. At age 29, she is among the three oldest victims in 2021 to date. Her death means a trans neighbor has been murdered every 8.5 days in 2022 in the United States. To date the victims include 7 Black trans women, 2 Latinx trans women, 1 AAIPI trans woman, 1 white trans man and 1 white trans woman. The youngest was 17, the oldest was 33. Nine were 25 or younger. Their deaths come on the heels of 2021, the most violent year in recorded history with the deaths of 57 trans, non-binary, and gender nonconforming people in the United States alone. Note that the tabulation includes a significant number of reports of folx murdered in 2021. This might be confusing. Of course it is confusing. I tried to sort it out below.
> 
> Rest in power, Fern. Your gentle soul was much loved by your friends and neighbors. You gave so much to our world, from reminding us to stop and literally smell the roses to showing compassion for all living creatures. You made this world a better place for all of us. I am so very sorry that your life was ripped away from you with a violence you personally abhorred. I am sorry your legacy of peaceful coexistence is challenged by a hateful narrative that is belied by how you led your life. I am sorry we did not create a safer world for you.
