> Irapuato.- Paris dances with joy. The music controls her body and she moves to the rhythm of the cumbia . This is the image with which her loved ones will remember her forever. She lost her life in a car accident . 
> 
> On Sunday morning, Paris was going out with her 4 friends and friends from a bar. They had gone out to have fun and, for safety reasons, they decided to order a taxi to have a responsible driver behind the wheel. Her cautious actions were useless, because a person in a drunken state hit them, thus taking the lives of the 6 on board the car, including the driver . 
> 
> As soon as she heard the news, Gisell , one of her close friends, wanted to share with people the true essence of Paris: a simple and charismatic person. She was like the trans woman who in her life made many people laugh and liked her.
