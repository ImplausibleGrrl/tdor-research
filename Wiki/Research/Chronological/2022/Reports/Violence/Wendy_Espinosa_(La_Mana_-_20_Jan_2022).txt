> The Quito Trans Psycho Center of the Silhouette X Association and members of the "New National Trans Network" Platform, together with different groups, announced that, during the night of last Thursday, January 20, 2022, Wendy Espinosa (Sandro José) , a 42-year-old trans woman, was murdered in La Maná, Cotopaxi province while she was outside her home.
> 
> The victim, who was with her brother-in-law Nelson A., was approached by two men on a motorcycle who opened fire on Espinosa and her brother-in-law, killing Wendy.
> 
> However, and despite the outcry from his relatives, the authorities have not yet clarified the motive for the murder, nor have they found the whereabouts of the culprits, for which groups from the trans community have asked the State Attorney General, Diana Salazar, the Undersecretary of Diversities, Felipe Ochoa, and the Ombudsman, Cesar Córdoba Valverde, pay more attention to this case in order to clarify the unfortunate events.
> 
> This death is added to that of Karla Valentina Espinosa , a trans woman who was found dead at her home in northwest Guayaquil with five stab wounds on January 4, and that of Cristian Nicola , a 27-year-old homosexual and official of the national prison service. , who died riddled with nine shots in the back during the day of January 6, thus accounting for 3 victims of the LGBTI + community so far in 2022.
> 
> Unfortunately and according to the Runa Sipiy records of the Silhouette X Association during 2021, the murders of ten trans women and five gay men have already been announced under the name of violent crimes and four of the 15 cases still remain unsolved, so that these organizations ask for greater visibility of the growing violence they are facing.
