> This one was almost missed due to misgendering but thanks to a local leader in the Black trans community we were made aware of this murder in Jacksonville, FL.
> 
> On January 2nd at 2:20a.m. Jacksonville Sheriff officers arrived on the scene at 4929 Skyway Dr, Jacksonville, FL 32246  (Ceil Apartments on Skyway Drive) after receiving a call that a victim of a car accident was laying in the parking lot of the apartments.
> 
> Upon arrival officers found the victim unresponsive near a parked vehicle and was rushed to a near by hospital where the victim passed. The victim was identified as a Black trans woman that went by the Duval Princess.
> 
> While in the hospital that the victim was pronounced dead in a doctor noticed that the injuries didn’t add up to a traffic incident and that foul play was involved. Detectives suspect foul play, and they say someone reported hearing shots fired in the area.
> 
> The case is now in the hands of the Sheriff’s homicide team and they’re looking for any leads that can provide answers.
> 
> #JusticeForThePrincess contact the Jacksonville Sheriff homicide team at: 904.630.0500
