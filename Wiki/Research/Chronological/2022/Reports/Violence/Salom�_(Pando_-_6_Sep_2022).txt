In addition, from the CTU they denounced that a media outlet "disrespected the gender identity" of the victim by treating her as "male" in the coverage of a newspaper article that recorded the murder. "The press is murdering again," they expressed, demanding reparation and that the identity of the victim be corrected.

Prosecutor Gabriela Yaniera, in charge of the case, has so far not found elements to classify transfemicide, but the investigation for the trial continues. The hypothesis is that the crime would be related to a drug problem.

> 
> Repudiation
> The Trans Collective of Uruguay lamented "again the news of a transfemicide" . In the statement he expressed: "Once again they took the life of a transgender partner.
