P. was stabbed following an argument in their apartment.

> A 32-year-old [trans person] from Bengaluru was allegedly stabbed to death by an auto driver last month. The incident joins a long list of episodes of violence against the members of the LGBTQIA+ community in India who have to face the risk to their safety on a daily basis, alongside dealing with social stigma and ostracisation.
> 
> The deceased, known as [possible deadname], was a resident of Bengaluruâ€™s BTM layout. While this incident occurred on May 30, his body was only discovered on June 2, after [their] neighbours complained that a foul smell was coming from [their] apartment. The accused, named Rakshith, is still absconding.
> 
> [P.] had been living in a rented flat for three months and would reportedly often invite men over to [their] apartment. According to the reports, a fight ensued between Rakshith and [P.] on May 30, when Rakshith came to his flat in a drunken state.
>
> Police reports reveal that [possible deadname] was the first to stab Rakshith, which enraged him and led him to repeatedly stab [P.] in the abdomen and left arm. After the fight ended fatally, Rakshith fled the crime scene.
