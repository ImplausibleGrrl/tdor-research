stabbed



> A 32-year-old cross-dresser from Bengaluru was allegedly stabbed to death by an auto driver last month. The incident joins a long list of episodes of violence against the members of the LGBTQIA+ community in India who have to face the risk to their safety on a daily basis, alongside dealing with social stigma and ostracisation.
> 
> The deceased, known as Pradeep, was a resident of Bengaluruâ€™s BTM layout. While this incident occurred on May 30, his body was only discovered on June 2, after his neighbours complained that a foul smell was coming from his apartment. The accused, named Rakshith, is still absconding.
> 
> Pradeep had been living in a rented flat for three months and would reportedly often invite men over to his apartment. According to the reports, a fight ensued between Rakshith and Pradeep on May 30, when Rakshith came to his flat in a drunken state.
> Police reports reveal that Pradeep was the first to stab Rakshith, which enraged him and led him to repeatedly stab Pradeep in the abdomen and left arm. After the fight ended fatally, Rakshith fled the crime scene.
