> 
> Pérola was lying on the floor bloodied on Rua Belarmino Fernandes Magalhães, in Tancredo Neves, near an abandoned lot, when she was found by a 28-year-old guard.
> 
> The Mobile Emergency Care Service was also called, but the young woman could not resist. The Association of Transvestites, Transsexuals and Transgenders of Roraima (Aterr) follows the case.
> 
> Residents informed the PM that the resident was the one who had murdered Pérola. He was arrested nearby. It is not yet known what motivated the crime.
> 
> "It is with regret that we record the murder of another TRANS person in Roraima. Pérola was not even able to consolidate a unique way of being called, which demonstrates her struggle as a TRANS person in the midst of a society that discriminates and excludes young people because of sexual orientation and gender identity," Aterr said in a statement.
