When police arrived, they found the bodies of Ray and Ruby Taveners’s brother, Bishop, in the apartment. Ruby Tavener’s car and cell phone were at the scene, so police believed she had fled on foot.

The Anime world was very near and dear to Ray’s heart. Youmakon, Anime Midwest, DokiDokon and other cos meet-ups are where Ray went to have fun and show off their unmatched talent and creativity. Ray was obsessed with all animals but Steele, Ray’s 11 year old cat and Milo, Ray’s “nephew” dog, were the favorites.
