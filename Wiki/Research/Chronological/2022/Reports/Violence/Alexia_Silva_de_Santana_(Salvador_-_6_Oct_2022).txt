> A couple was shot dead on Thursday night (6) in the São Marcos neighborhood of Salvador. The suspicion is that the victims were executed by traffickers . The family of one of them believes the crime is related to a fight over a garbage bag. The Civil Police, however, does not confirm this version and says that it is still investigating the authorship and motivation of the double homicide.
> 
> The victims were identified as bricklayer's helper Lairton de Souza, 23, and his wife, Alexia Silva de Santana, 19, a trans woman. According to Lairton's father, the last contact with his son was Thursday night by phone. During a call, the victim said that she was tired from work, but that she needed to leave to settle an argument involving his wife and an alleged neighbor.
> 
> “He said that his wife had had a fight with the neighbor and that it was not the first time this had happened, precisely because of a garbage bag. He went out to settle with the neighbor passively. I asked him not to change and he told me it was ok. Half an hour later, I called again and could not contact him and his companion. After an hour, I received the news that my son had died”, said the family member in an interview with TV Record Itapoan.
> 
> The couple, who lived on Rua Paracaína, were found injured on Rua Celina Ferreira. In a photo, which would have been taken before the murders, the two appear sitting on a sidewalk with their hands behind their backs, apparently tied. Military Police say they were called to attend to a case involving two people injured by gunshots. The victims were rescued by agents to an Emergency Care Unit (UPA) in São Marcos, where they could not resist their injuries.
> 
> Family members of the bricklayer's helper also say that the couple was taken out of the house and that all the furniture was taken from the space. The Civil Police reported that the double homicide is being investigated by the Department of Homicide and Protection of the Person (DHPP). So far, no one has been arrested.
