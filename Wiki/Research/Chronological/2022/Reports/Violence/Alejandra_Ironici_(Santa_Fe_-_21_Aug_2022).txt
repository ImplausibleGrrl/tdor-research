Transfemicide: Alejandra Ironici, pioneer of the transvestite struggle in Santa Fe, was murdered
Alejandra Ironici was 43 years old and was a pioneer activist in transvestite and trans struggles. She was murdered in her house de ella in Santa Fe. The Prosecutor's Office is already investigating her death de ella as transfemicide.


SANTA FE CITY, Santa Fe. The Santa Fe trans figure, Alejandra Ironici, was murdered in her home – Public Passage 8133 -, in the northwest of the city. She was 43 years old and was the coordinator of the Movement for Social, Ethnic and Religious Integration (MISER) Santa Fe, she was the promoter of important advances in human rights for the transvestite collective. Alejandra was the first to receive her DNI with the registration change and to access a teaching position in the State of Santa Fe, among other actions.

what is known so far
This Sunday, August 21, around 11 pm, Alejandra's nephew - who lives in the same house - returned from work, and when he entered there was a fire in the bedroom. Upon entering, according to what he stated to the Police, he found his aunt with signs of burns and in a pool of blood. I immediately called 911.

When the police arrived at the scene, they confirmed that the victim was already dead. They began the operation to preserve the scene of the incident and asked for experts and a health unit to attend (which never arrived).

In the tour of the house, the young man alerted the Police that his aunt's car, which would be a GRAY FIAT PALIO, would not be found in the garage, nor would Alejandra's current partner, with whom she would have a relationship for about five months. This morning, they found Alejandra's car in Padre Dusso at 7200 in the city of Santa Fe. A person was also arrested in the same place. 

The detainee is a 32-year-old man, whose initials are DHB. He was Alejandra's current partner. The arrest occurred in a house in front of which the victim's car was.

The case is being investigated by the Santa Fe Femicide Brigade, in charge of the prosecutor Alejandra Del Río Ayala. In the next few hours, he will request the Office of Judicial Management to set the day and time for the impeachment hearing of the detainee.

In March 2018, after two transfemicides perpetrated in the capital of Santa Fe and the area - that of Adriana Cuqui Bonetto and that of Sol - it was Alejadra Ironici who explained to Presentes: "Most trans women in the city and its surroundings live alone and in peripheral areas, which deepens their situation of vulnerability.”

A trans pioneer in Santa Fe: "Proud of what I am"
Victoria Alejandra Ironici had many titles. Her life was one of struggle and, above all, achievement. She was the first trans woman to get a DNI that respects her identity, even before the law guaranteed that right for everyone. If all the actions in which she was a pioneer began to be enumerated, the list would include all the claims achieved by the Santa Fe transvestite collective.

Her story of struggle begins at the age of 18, when she was kicked out of her house for being trans. She came from Vera to Santa Fe capital to find more opportunities. In 2007, after losing a job, she began the administrative process for the province of Santa Fe to recognize her identity. 

In 2010, two months before the Gender Identity Law was sanctioned, a ceremony was held at Government House. The then Governor Antonio Bonfatti gave him his rectified birth certificate and DNI.

“My new life begins. I will go out with my head held high, proud of who I am . Without having to hide, because I did not commit any crime. All I did was choose a different life. That meant that I was denied a lot of rights , ”she said that day when she began to be Victoria Alejandra Ironici. "I wanted Selenia as a third name but she will have to stay as my stage name," she joked.

That day he also told his next goals: to get a job and have a vaginoplasty. He met both goals and continued to break new ground. In 2013, she was the first trans woman to undergo the surgical procedure through the social work of the province and in a hospital in Buenos Aires.

Alejandra was a great promoter of the transvestite quota at different levels of the State and national organizations. She was studying law at the Universidad Nacional del Litoral , and she was one of the promoters of the quota in that house of higher studies. 

On May 31, in dialogue with Presentes for a note on the quota in Argentine universities, he said: “On a social and cultural level, it positions us differently. Society is going to see that we want to go for more acceptance and inclusion and that the UNL gives its support, through a resolution that is the product of our project and of the national law”. That path had already been traveled with the struggle in the province and in the provincial capital.

Teacher and activist: “The educational system, with us”

Last year, Alejandra and Lucy Gimenez became the first trans teachers to agree to substitute classes in secondary schools in the city . “It is the fundamental door of what we have been fighting for: the educational system had to be with us. In that process we had been working with Lucy to break that social prejudice. Today we have to do it from within the schools, already as teachers, ”she said on that occasion.

Ale was a pioneer. He opened paths for her and for those who come after her. Every day of her life de ella was a struggle to break the 40-year life expectancy that the group has. However, she could not and today her name de ella is in the headline of that news from which she did everything to escape.
