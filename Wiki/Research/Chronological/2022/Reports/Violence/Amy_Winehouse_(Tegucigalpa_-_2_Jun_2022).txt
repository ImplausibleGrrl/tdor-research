tortured and murdered




> TEGUCIGALPA, HONDURAS.- The young woman who was found lifeless, with signs of torture and without clothes under the air bridge of the El Prado neighborhood in the capital was identified this Thursday.
> 
> According to the forensic report, her name was Kristian Elías Martínez Martínez, but within the LGTBI community she was known as Amy Winehouse, just like the British singer and songwriter who died in 2011.
> 
> Her body was found last Saturday May 28 at around 7:00 in the morning.
> 
> The authorities detailed that at the place of the discovery there were clothes and some personal items, but they did not find identification, so it had to be recognized with the autopsy.
> 
> So far no details have been provided about the person responsible for the violent act.
> 
> The KAI surveillance unit mourned the death of Amy Winehouse, whom they described as "a trans girl with a personalized character."
> 
> “We urge the authorities to immediately carry out the corresponding investigations that can clarify the fact and obtain an immediate response to Mrs. Martha Martínez, who was her only relative,” requests the organization in favor of the LGTBI community.
> 
> Similarly, they called on the State to comply with the sentence issued by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in the case of Vicky Hernández, which urges the State to apply the protocols for monitoring and investigating the cases of violence against LGBTI people.
