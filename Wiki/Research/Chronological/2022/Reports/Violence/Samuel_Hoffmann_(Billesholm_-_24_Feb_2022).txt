> Samuel Hoffmann was a 30-something Jewish trans man who was murdered in Billesholm, Sweden on the 24th of February 2022. My Swedish friend notified me about Samuel and asked that I report his death here on his behalf. He was a parent and it is suspected that his murderer is his boyfriend. But not much really is known so far about him. The press and police misgendered him in reports, such as this one:

> My friend also provided a picture of Samuel, I can't seem to attach it here though
