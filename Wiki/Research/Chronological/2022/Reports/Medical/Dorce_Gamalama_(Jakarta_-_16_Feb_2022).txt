> 
> Popular trans entertainer Dorce Gamalama has died in Indonesia from complications related to COVID-19, but her family has decided she should be buried as a man.
> 
> Gamalama, a well-known pop singer and TV presenter who even had her own talkshow, the Dorce Show, passed away in hospital in Jakarta on Wednesday (16 February). She was often referred to as Bunda (mother) Dorce.
> 
> The 58-year-old had been diagnosed with COVID-19 three weeks previously, and other health conditions including Alzheimer’s and diabetes increased the severe complications associated with the virus.
> 
> Gamalama had been openly trans for decades, having undergone gender affirmation surgery in 1983 and even winning a legal battle to have her gender legally recognised.
> 
> In an interview last month, she referenced her deteriorating health in an interview and announced: “[I would like to be buried] as I am now. Because after my surgery, I have a female genitalia, so women should bathe me, and bathe [and bury] me as a woman.”
> 
> However, as a devout Muslim, she added the decision would ultimately lie with faith leaders.
> 
> Following her public announcement that she would like to be buried as a woman, the Indonesia Ulema Council (MUI), Indonesia’s top Islamic scholars body, said in a statement that the body of a trans person must always be buried according to their gender assigned at birth. So, despite her final wishes, her family and religious leaders decided that she should be bathed and buried as a man.
> 
> Carahanna Marianne Sam, a trans campaign manager at an NGO in South Jakarta, told The Jakarta Post that despite her limited involvement with the LGBT+ community in Indonesia, Gamalama made a huge impact by being visible.
> 
> “I hope we can have more Dorce Gamalamas in Indonesia,” she said.
> 
> “She’s still a hero. Just by being out there and existing, she already has done more than half of what the rest of us have done.”


> The multi-talented Dorce Gamalama, one of Indonesia’s modern pioneers for trans visibility, passed away this morning. She was 58 years old.
> 
> The comedian/TV host/musician’s death was confirmed by her best friend, Hetty Soendjaya, who said that Dorce passed away at 7:30am at a hospital in West Jakarta due to COVID-19. As of this morning, Hetty and Dorce’s family were finalizing funeral arrangements as she has to be buried with COVID-19 protocols.
> 
> It was previously reported that Dorce often checked in and out of hospital due to diabetes. Her health began deteriorating last October, when she needed the aid of a wheelchair as she was unable to walk. The artist was also diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, which affected her memory and speech.
> 
> Despite the numerous health issues, Dorce said she was eager to recover and even filmed a music video.
> 
> Dorce, who’s a transwoman, made headlines in late January after expressing her intention to be buried as a woman to the dismay of Islamic authorities in the country. The celebrated entertainer (who may have gained more detractors amid Indonesia’s rising conservatism in recent years), opened up about her wishes for after she passes away in a recent interview with basketball player-turned-podcaster Denny Sumargo.

> “Bunda, when you pass away, what would you want to die as?” Denny asked Dorce.
> 
> “As I am now. Because after my [sex reassignment] surgery, I have a female genitalia, so women should bathe me, bathe me as a woman,” Dorce answered.
> 
> Dorce’s response became a topic of discussion in Indonesia, where there is still a long way to go for LGBTQ+ acceptance. Among those who voiced their opinion was Cholil Nafis, the chairman of Indonesia Ulema Council (MUI), the highest Islamic clerical body in the nation. Cholil wrote in a tweet that the body of a transgender should be taken care of according to their assigned gender at birth for funeral rites, as gender change is not recognized in Islam.
