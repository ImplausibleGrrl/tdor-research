> Mysterious death of an Argentine trans in Rome who had met with the Pope
> Rome
> 
> He was 48 years old and had been born in Chaco. A few days ago she was found dead, naked, on a bed, in a hotel in one of the deep urban outskirts of Rome, in Italy. Naomi Cabral was an Argentinian transsexual (whose ID included the name Alejandro Daniel Cabral). She received her clients from her in a small apartment of the Samoa Hotel in Tor San Lorenzo, two steps from Torvaianica, on the Roman coast: there she was found dead on October 6 by Claudia, a transsexual, compatriot and Naomi's neighbor.
> 
> Pending the autopsy, the case is a mystery that revolves around a key question: at the time of death, was Naomi alone and something happened to her or someone spent those last hours with her? Perhaps that “someone” was frightened by the trans woman's discomfort from her and decided to escape from her place, leaving her to die instead of asking for help. 
> 
> There has been a lot of talk about the "Naomi file" in the local media, while investigators check the security cameras in the area in search of any useful clues.
> 
> Everything now depends on the result of the autopsy ordered by the Italian prosecutors who are investigating the ramified local world of drugs, in addition to tracking possible traces of narcotics or drugs in the body of the Argentine. There is no doubt about the fact that many hours passed between the moment of her death de ella and the moment in which her friend de ella Claudia knocked, uselessly, on the door of Naomi's room and found her lifeless. 
> 
> Meanwhile, the Roman media talk about the case: "Dead Trans, on the hunt for the last client," headlines, for example, Il Messaggero, the capital's main newspaper.
> 
> The colors of the periphery. The entire story that revolves around Naomi, not just her outcome, has a “Pasolinian” background. Before the whole site, the coast of Rome: the murder of Pier Paolo Pasolini, which occurred in 1975, took place in Ostia, 20 kilometers from Torvaianica. In this area to the south of the capital there are well-cultivated fields and industrial establishments, as well as a lot of cement and long blocks with low-story apartments.
> 
> Father Andrea Conocchia is the parish priest of this area squeezed between the seashore and the Pontina, the highway that reaches Rome from the south. The priest proudly recounts his visit to him some time ago from the Merlo-Moreno diocese in Buenos Aires while receiving PROFILE at the Beata Vergine Immacolata church at the end of a crowded mass on a working day.
> 
> “Torvaianica has the perfume and colors of the periphery. Here there are good people, very simple, and migrant friends with temporary jobs who during the winter do not know where they live, where they go. There are also pockets of marginality and, on the other hand, the fact that in our territory there have been –and perhaps still are– mafia 'families' is something that everyone knows,” he said. 
> 
> And he continued: “There is a lot of drug running as well as arrests for drug trafficking and usury. Many teenagers have been abandoned to their fate. Most of the people living in Torvaianica are elderly while many young people are just passing through. Here you can find apartments at a more affordable price than in Rome, there are many who leave after a while”.
> 
> Father Andrea does not rule out the possibility that Naomi's was a violent death. "Perhaps that day in that hotel room there was alcohol, drugs (overdose?) or perhaps the cause of death was due to private sexual performance."
> 
> The priest, who is at the forefront of this complex economic and social reality, has long organized meetings of groups of transsexuals with the Pope. Accompanied by the French nun Genevieve Jeanningros, on April 27 Francis received four South American transsexuals from Torvaianica: Naomi was one of them. That day Minerva (Peruvian), Laura (Paraguayan) and Marcela (Uruguayan) were also in the Vatican.
> 
> “That was the first of a series of similar initiatives that we managed to organize after the outbreak of the pandemic. It all started when Naomi and other girls showed up one day at the gate of our church and asked us for food: we gave them pasta, tomatoes, flour, vegetables, coffee, sugar. From then on, they told me that they prostituted themselves. Since they could not work on the street due to anti-virus measures, they urgently needed help, they could not even pay for the rooms where they receive their clients. For me, transsexuality was an unknown world, but little by little I learned to listen to them and get to know them”. 
> 
> But at one point the father had an idea and proposed to them: "You are Argentineans, if you write the history of your living conditions, perhaps the Pope, who is like a parish priest from all over the world, will give you a hand." Said and done, the letters that the girls sent to Francisco were obviously written in Spanish, in addition to being accompanied by little drawings, little hearts and flowers. I sent them to the Pope's Almoner, Cardinal Konrad Krajeweski, who promptly responded by approving the grants. He then sent us fifty anti-Covid vaccines in an ambulance, in addition to tests, swabs, food: everything destined for our transsexual community, of which the Pope is a close friend. The meeting we had with the Pope was precisely to thank this help”.
> 
> How did Francisco react after hearing the news of Naomi's death? “Sister Genvieve visited him again recently and brought him a card with a photo of Naomi from our meeting with him. Francisco thanked the gesture and commented that he will be able to pray and remember her.
> 
> Minerva and Laura also participated in the meeting with Father Andrea in his parish. "I arrived in Italy years ago after a long journey, from Lima to Bolivia, then Argentina and finally Rome," recalls Minerva. “There are no precise traces of Naomi's death, the truth is I have no idea what happened, but what is said in our environment is that she died of cocaine contaminated with a poison. Cocaine is everywhere and where there is trans there is drugs, this is the sad reality”.
> 
> “We want to know what happened – Laura adds for her part –, we have the right to know what happened to Naomi. We are human beings."
