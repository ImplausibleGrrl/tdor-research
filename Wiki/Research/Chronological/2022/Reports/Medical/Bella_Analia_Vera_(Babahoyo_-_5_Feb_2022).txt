> Josefa Sánchez still had in her hands the syringe with the substance that, according to her, ended the life of Bella, her trans daughter. According to the lady, they would have injected it to highlight her attributes of her. Bella Analía, 34, was a popular trans girl who participated in several beauty pageants for the LGBTI community in Babahoyo, Los Ríos.
> 
> According to Josefa, her son was fine until the night of Friday, February 4, 2021, in the building they shared located on Rocafuerte and ByPass streets. However, she tells the parent, she did not notice when the person who applied the oils to Bella to increase her buttocks arrived. “He was a man who traveled from Quito to do that to him (inject him with oil). Now I want justice because his death cannot go unpunished, ”said Josefa crying.
> 
> Bella would have entrusted her body to the same person who injected her breasts and buttocks several years ago. However, the trans girl wanted to look more voluptuous and she asked for a new application without knowing that it would be her last.
> 
> “She told me that she was going to wear more and we asked her not to do it anymore, but vanity blinded her. You risk your life when you inject yourself because you don't know how your body is going to react. The cheapest per application costs around $100”, declared a friend of the deceased.
> 
> After the application, the damage became visible around 04:00 on Saturday, February 5, 2022, when Josefa heard her complaining in the room. "I knocked on her door and her husband opened it for me, but she was already foaming at the mouth," said the parent.
> 
> They quickly called an ambulance and took her to the Martín Icaza hospital in Babahoyo. There they tried to revive her but Bella Analía no longer had vital signs. Her body was taken to the local morgue, where they also took samples of the substance that Josefa carried in a syringe.
> 
> Bella was queen of the non-profit Foundation Let me live as I am, but she also had extensive experience in beauty pageants. Her overwhelming and charismatic personality made her win the affection of the public.
> 
> Now Josefa only hopes to get justice for Bella's death. The deceased made a living dyeing hair in a mini beauty salon that she set up in her home. The deceased leaves two children in the orphanage and her remains will be buried today in the cemetery of the Rio de Janeiro capital.
