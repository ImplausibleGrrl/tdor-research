> Updated at 09:22 am - Server of the Legislative Assembly, artist and social activist from Cuiabana Hend Santana, 30, died in the early hours of this Wednesday (11), a victim of cardiorespiratory arrest. Last week, she won 3rd place at the Festival Prima Canta 2022, promoted by the Secretary of Culture of Primavera do Leste and in March she received the Black Resistance award.
> 
> Hend's death is already felt on the city's political and cultural scene. Pedagogue Antonieta Luisa Costa was one of the first to mourn her friend's departure. “It is with great sadness that I communicate the death of dear Hend Santana, a black and trans woman, activist in the struggle for Human Rights”, she said, noting that the singer leaves a legacy of great joy.
> 
> Hend was a known presence in the Cuiabano underground since when the rock scene was powerful, as was his voice. He even had a rock band with his brothers when he was still a student at Escola Estadual Presidente Médici.

> The band didn't last, but she didn't give up on art. She played shows around the city and ventured into jazz. At the same time, thanks to an article by journalist Rodivaldo Ribeiro entitled “Música Gorda”, he created his first authorial work in 2017, with 5 songs that transit between pop, new MPB, electronic beats and full of references to R&B. Check out below her participation in the TVAL program Sons de Mato Grosso.

> In a statement, the Secretary of Culture, Sport and Leisure mourned Hend's death and highlighted her fight against fatphobia, racism and transphobia. “Hend was the curator of the 26th Salão Jovem Arte de Mato Grosso, which took place recently. The first non-binary transgender to participate in Miss Plus Size Diversity, Hend Santana gained visibility with her artistic performances, songs loaded with theatrics and strong speech in favor of the LGBTIA+ cause. In this moment of immense pain, the entire Secel-MT team expresses its deepest condolences and solidarity to family and friends.

> The filmmaker and cultural producer from Cuiabá Luiz Marchetti recalled the talent, love and humor of his friend, who he called a star. “Our star was singing in the sky [...] how sad, my God”, he lamented.
