> Fucking Trans Women, sometimes abbreviated FTW, is a 'zine created by Mira Bellwether, to date consisting of a single 80-page issue "#0", published in October 2010 and republished in 2013 as Fucking Trans Women: A Zine About the Sex Lives of Trans Women. Bellwether wrote all of the articles in the issue, which explores a variety of sexual activities involving trans women, primarily ones who are pre-op or non-op with respect to bottom surgery. It was innovative in its focus on trans women's own perspectives and its inclusion of instructions for many of the sex acts depicted. Emphasizing sex acts possible with flaccid penises or not involving penises at all, it coined the term "muffing" to refer to stimulation of the inguinal canal, and popularized that act. Since its publication it has received both popular-culture and scholarly attention, being described in Sexuality & Culture as "a comprehensive guide to trans women's sexuality"[2] and in Playboy as "widely considered to be the first and most in-depth guide to having sex with pre- and non-op trans femme bodies."[3]


> In October 2021, our amazing Mira was diagnosed with lung cancer and underwent surgery to remove the affected lobe at NYU Langone Tisch hospital. During a long and difficult recovery from surgery, in August 2022 we received the devastating news that the cancer has returned at stage four. Mira started receiving chemotherapy on September 9th, and is understandably extremely scared for the future. Without great means ourselves, we have made the difficult decision to ask friends, allies and kind-hearted strangers for your support to help with Mira’s healthcare, support, and wellbeing.
> 
> Cancer treatment is very expensive in the US even with insurance, and treatment costs can typically run into five or six digits. We’re asking for your support to cover expenses including medical treatments and diagnostic procedures not covered by insurance, covid-safe transportation to and from chemo infusions and doctors appointments, associated costs of care that must be paid out of pocket, much-needed but expensive personal care items like wigs and nutritional supplements, and lost household income due to illness and caretaking..
> 
> Mira is a disabled trans woman who is already on immunosuppressive medications in addition to chemotherapy, so navigating a post-mask-mandate New York is more vital and difficult than ever. Your donations will help keep Mira going and ensure her support system meets her needs while she handles the biggest challenge she’s ever faced. We are so grateful in advance for your generosity towards our family. Thank you!
