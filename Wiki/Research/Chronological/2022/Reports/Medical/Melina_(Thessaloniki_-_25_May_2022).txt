> There is a trans woman who died in Thessaloniki, Greece this May. The cause of death is unknown, but she her body was left unrecognized by her family at the hospital and it was only after local organizations mobilized that she received a proper burial and the municipality became aware of this. She was a sex worker and there was a bit of confusion about her name in the limited press that she received. She was reported as Bali, like the island due to an inside joke among her friends, but her name is Melina!

> Tomorrow the funeral of transgender Melina: The chronicle from the unclaimed hospital to the solution of the problem
>
> From yesterday when the sad news about the trans woman who was "stuck" in the unclaimed rooms of the "Papageorgiou" hospital in Thessaloniki was widely known until today when the solution to the problem was announced, what has become clear is that on the one hand the sensitivity and mobilization of the trans community and of the mayor of Thessaloniki , quickly brought the solution, on the other hand they highlighted in a sad way the reality experienced by trans people in Greece as well as the obstacles with the bureaucratic procedures when someone is "in the unclaimed".
> 
> The story goes like this: Melina (also known as Bali), a transgender sex worker from Thessaloniki ended up in Papageorgiou Hospital last Wednesday (25/5/2022). He suffered from leukemia. Her relatives initially refused to undertake the burial.
> 
> "The reasons are many," Angeliki Souglé , lawyer and partner of the organization Red Umbrella Athens, describes to Newsbeast and continues: "The one who ran for the death certificate is her close friend. Since then, Melina has remained in the hospital's refrigerator.
> 
> The hospital began to push to get out, as places are limited . Relatives did not sign. At the same time, for a dead person to be considered unclaimed, three months must pass since the death.
> 
> The friend finally turned to the NGO "Positive Voice" which, in collaboration with Red Umbrella Athens and Pride Thessaloniki, began to investigate the issue in order to find an immediate solution. The actions of the journalist Constantinos Tsakiris who sensitively dealt with the issue also played a catalytic role."

> As Ms. Sougle continues to explain to us, yesterday, Monday 30/5/2022, after consultation, a vehicle of the Municipality of Thessaloniki transported a relative of Melina to the hospital to sign the disclaimer and finally the way was opened for the funeral and burial . "Fanis Baboulas (s.s. funeral home) agreed to undertake the burial with a coffin free of charge. He himself had to transfer the body to his own refrigerator, as he did," describes Ms. Sougle and adds: "Thus, the funeral will take place tomorrow at 4:30 p.m. in the Holy Church of the Resurrection of the Lord in Thessaloniki. Melina had expressed the desire to be buried in a religious way and her friend wanted the same . The cost for the grave, about 400.00 euros, was personally taken over by the Mayor of Thessaloniki, Mr. Zervas."

> The chronic problem with people living "unclaimed"
> However, Ms. Sugle emphasizes that problems like the above with people who remain "unclaimed" for a shorter or longer time are unfortunately chronic. As she notes: "We faced a similar incident some time ago in Athens with a refugee sex worker from a Southeast Asian country.

> The 60-year-old transgender woman was known by the name "Bali" and, according to people who knew her, was working in Thessaloniki as a sex worker, while facing a serious health problem.
> 
> The issue was brought to the public by activists and members of LGBTQIcommunity, with the aim of finding an immediate solution, since, as they claim, the first degree relatives refused to receive the body and made it clear that they have nothing to do with the particular person and are not interested. In addition, according to information from protothema.gr, few people from the wider family environment of the 60-year-old who showed interest after her death and the dimensions the matter took, reported that they are unable to cover the expenses for her funeral and therefore will to be fully undertaken by Konstantinos Zervas and the Municipality of Thessaloniki.

> " A few days ago a transgender woman from Thessaloniki lost her life and since then she has been in the refrigerator of the Papageorgiou hospital in Thessaloniki.
> 
> Her relatives show no interest in taking her and giving her a dignified burial as every human being deserves. (The good things about being transgender in Greece, while even today some dare to talk about choice). Any person who knows any structure or service in Thessaloniki that could help, I would beg you with all my might sincerely. No man deserves to be left unclaimed, my soul bleeds.

> The girl's name was Bali, she lived in Thessaloniki and I repeat she has been in the refrigerators at the Papageorgiou hospital for days. As many friends as you are from Thessaloniki and have in mind anything that would help you, please do so. Even from Athens if we know something that would help", she wrote on Facebook, sharing the photo of the 60-year-old trans woman.
