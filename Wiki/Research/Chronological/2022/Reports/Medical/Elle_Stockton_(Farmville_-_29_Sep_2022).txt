> The very last thing Elle shared before her passing was one of my posts. I lack the words to express ho much the loss o Girl Inside pains me. She lived into her 60s, and passed from common health problems. When so many of us die at someones hands (often our own) this is something to commemorate and cherish. She will be sorely missed.

> Elle was one of the only people with whom I could have a full on argument about religion, politics, or philosophy and then, when we were done, easily return to snark and coffee. We shared an appreciation for directness. I will miss her voice in real life and online.
