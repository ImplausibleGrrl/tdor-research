> Mystery of porn star Angelina Please's death may never be solved as she's already been cremated, family fears
> 
> THE family of the late trans porn star Angelina Please say they may never know how she died and claim she has already been cremated.

> 
> The porn star was found dead in March at her Las Vegas apartment.
>

> 
> However, they are still demanding answers after allegedly being told they would have had to pay $4k for a private autopsy while mystery still surrounds his death.
> 
> They have also previously told The Sun that they are concerned that thousands of dollars may have been stolen from a safe in his apartment after his death, while police have yet to confirm that they are investigating.
> 
> Her brother Lonnie revealed that she was cremated on April 12 at Palm Downtown Mortuary & Cemetery in Las Vegas, leaving them "with more questions than answers."

> 
> “My mom told me that she had not received the death certificate yet, also when I called the morgue to stop the cremation and they gave me the news that it had happened, the woman said that there should be an autopsy.

> 
> When asked about any investigation into Francesca's death, a police spokesman also added: "This is still a dead body report."

> A devastated Lonnie continued, "We didn't even have access to their apartment for about three days, they always treated us poorly, never let us in on time, etc.
> 
> "Francesca was a human being loved by her family, friends and fans. But I feel like my sister was treated differently than the average 24-year-old cisgender woman who died.
> 
> “Every day my mom loses sleep, lives with paralyzing anxiety and hardly gets out of bed.
> 
> “It breaks my heart. This whole situation just kills us. I never felt true pain and suffering until I lost my little sister."
> 
> "I take a night terror medication that helps me sleep by decreasing the intensity of my nightmares about his death."
> 
> According to neighbor and fellow actor Aspen Brooks, Angelina had allegedly been missing for five days.

> 
> “I don't know how long she had been there, they found her in the room, she was unrecognizable so they can't identify her.
>

> 
> Stephanie's daughter told her that she was looking forward to attending the AVN Awards in Las Vegas, where she was nominated for the 'Trans Artist of the Year' category.

> 
> A police report was not available at press time, but a tweet from fellow performer Aspen Brooks—who was Please’s neighbor—indicates that police were called to Please’s locked residence after she hadn’t been heard from in nearly five days. Her body was found inside, and a source indicated that authorities detected no signs of violence or foul play.

> “I’m at a loss for words,” Brooks tweeted. “Went to go check on my friend after she had been missing, only to find out we lost an amazing person. One of my best friends. My neighbor. The person I would gossip with about everything. She was just 24 years old. RIP baby girl.”
> 
> Grooby owner Steven Grooby told AVN, "It's just the most awful news to hear. I heard she was missing when her friend, Aspen, posted about it, but hearing that she'd passed is devastating. Angelina was 24 and in the prime of her life, a popular and professional performer. I want to pass on my love and respect to her family and friends. It's difficult to have the words."

> Added veteran Grooby producer/director Buddy Wood, "I was literally just working with her two weeks ago and she was great, and super excited to go to the TEA awards this weekend. I'm shocked to hear this. She was great, a really fun, nice girl and very professional. So sorry to hear it."

> 
> “Angelina offered to come by early and help us set everything up,” Kisses said. “That’s the type of person she was. She seemed fine that day. She was her normal, cheery self.”
> 
> Kisses said the scene was the best thing she’s shot for TransAngels thus far.
> 
> “She pulled the scene together,” Kisses said, “and she took these stunning photos. We had three head dresses and one was different. We gave it to her and put her in the middle. She was wearing white and she had Cloudy Vi and Jade Venus on either side of her, in the middle of this fairy wonderland, with all of this smoke coming up. She was this goddess in the middle of it. I just can’t stop thinking about those photos we took. She was the highlight of the scene.”
> 
> Kisses believes Please was on the cusp of taking her career to another level.
> 
> “I kept telling her, ‘You’re going to win awards this year,” Kisses recalled. “She was so well-prepared for all of her scenes. And she was a gorgeous, phenomenal performer. She just glowed. She made the days go by so easy. She knew what to do. She was a good friend. She was my favorite trans person in the industry; she was someone I really loved being around.
> 
> “I’m just having a tough time accepting that this is happening. I just can’t believe it.”
> 
> A Chicago native, Please entered the industry in 2019. She was one of the 15 nominees for Trans Performer of the Year at the at the 2022 AVN Awards, and her threesome with Ariel Demure and Jenna Creed for Devil’s Film was nominated for Best Trans Group Scene.
