> Today I had the sad news of my friend from New York MICHELLE Michelle S Tarrio came to pass away Friday, in a surgery to remove and reconstruction of her body, a battle that for years had been facing problems with silicone, I myself witnessed this and martyrdom when I visited her and passed some days in your company at your home in New York, interrupted suffering that no human being deserves to go through.
> 
> The battle has settled down! America today is sadder, the LGBT world New Yorker and our BRAZILIAN DAY will not be the same! Rest in Peace my Portuguese friend
> 
> MAY GOD HAVE YOU IN A GOOD PLACE Eternal Memories - thanks for everything.
