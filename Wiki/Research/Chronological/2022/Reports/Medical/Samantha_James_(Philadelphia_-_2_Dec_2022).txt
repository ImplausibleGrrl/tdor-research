> Cookie Tookie just passed 12/2/2022. She was a Trans woman, internet star, and really big in the ballroom scene. I'm not sure what happened, but she had been having some bad problems for a while and from what I can tell was living on the streets. People talking about her keep mentioning her struggles and demons, so possibly an overdose, but I don't really know for sure.
