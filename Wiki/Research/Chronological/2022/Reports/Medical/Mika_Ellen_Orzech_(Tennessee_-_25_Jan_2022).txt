> RIP Mika Ellen Orzech
> I knew you had been ill for some time but still am so saddened and heartbroken you have (to quote Monty Python) “snuffed it”. 
> You were one of the first trans people I met back when I was a baby trans at a group therapy session at Fenway Community Health in 2007. I was so impressed by your strength and tenacity and perseverance through all that you had gone through during your journey. But I was also taken by your wit and wisdom and thoughtfulness. You could be so ascerbic (and who could blame you) but also so tender and caring to us “kids”. 
> I was so happy you had found your love in Mandy. I know how deeply you loved her and cared about her. And I could tell she felt the same way about you. I am so saddened for her (and all our) loss now that you have passed. 
> I will miss your passion and your brashness about the trans community and how we are so often preyed upon and marginalized. How you fought against such in your own special way. 
> The world is now lessened with you having moved on. 
> My love to you. May you find peace in your next plane of existence. Look over us trans siblings. We could use it.



> I am saddened to announce that Mika Ellen Orzech passed away this evening after 9:30pm.  We were coming up on our 11 year anniversary next Monday.  I am heartbroken beyond words.  I can’ stop crying.  She was my world.  She was the glue that held me together in this cruel and evil world.   She was my one and only true love and soulmate..........

> Sorry I have not been on here very much today. I’ve really not felt well at all. Mandy thinks it’s Omicron. Whatever it is, it’s nasty, but nowhere near as bad as those first two rounds of Covid-19. Mostly nausea, vomiting, and extreme fatigue/weakness. [17 Jan]
