The family of Lorraine Alves, 22, disputes the version that the transsexual would have died after an aesthetic procedure performed in São Paulo. The victim died last Wednesday (08), at Anápolis State Hospital Dr. Henrique Santillo (HEANA).

In an interview with Portal 6 , this Saturday (11), Lorraine's aunt, Ana Paula Fernandes, said that her niece warned, through WhatsApp messages, that she would undergo a procedure to place silicone in her buttocks. However, everything would have been carried out in a clandestine clinic, inside a nightclub in Anápolis.

“Everything was done in town and a friend took Lorraine to have the surgery,” he said.

In the days before the event, Ana Paula alleges that the transsexual presented a strange behavior whenever other people were around. The cell phone she used to contact has not yet been found.

According to her aunt, she arrived in Anápolis just over a month ago, seeking to financially improve the life of her family, who live in Belém do Pará.

“She was our base, a wonderful person, very polite. We didn't know she was going to Annapolis to do this kind of thing, so it was a shock to everyone,” she says.

Portal 6 also had access to the last audio Lorraine sent to the family before her death. In the recording, the transsexual is grateful for the support she was receiving from her closest loved ones.

“I appreciate everything you've done for me and my family. I really appreciate you! When we needed it most, you were the only person who stood by our side. So I recognize that and I know I can count on you. I'm too far away, but I worry," he said.

In addition to grief, the family also deals with the difficulty of burying Lorraine in the city where she was born and lived. As the transsexual was found only with her birth certificate, the Legal Medical Institute (IML) could not have identified the fingerprint.

The victim's sister arrived in Anápolis this Saturday (11) to perform a DNA test and recognize the body.

The forecast was that Lorraine would be buried as unknown next Monday (13), but the family managed to get a week's deadline for the delivery of the exam results and to make possible the transport to Belém.

“We have resorted to crowdfunding and asked for help from the State. She has to be buried where she was born, with her family”, emphasizes the aunt.

The case is with the Civil Police, which is investigating the nature of the procedure that Lorraine had, as well as the day, place and professional responsible for the surgery.

The cadaver report should come out in the next few days. With the data, agents should be able to explain what really happened.
