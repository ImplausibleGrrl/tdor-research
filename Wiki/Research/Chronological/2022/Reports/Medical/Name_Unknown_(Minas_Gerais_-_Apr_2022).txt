> Two are arrested for applying industrial silicone to the buttocks of a transvestite and taking her to death in MG 
> 
> The Civil Police of Minas Gerais (PCMG) presented, this Tuesday morning (21), the results of the investigation into the death of a 36-year-old transvestite, after application of industrial silicone, in April this year. Last Wednesday (15), two temporary arrest warrants and one search and seizure warrants were served against a 38-year-old trans woman and a 22-year-old woman in the Coqueiros neighborhood, in Belo Horizonte. The duo would have performed the procedure on the victim in a clandestine, unhealthy place and without the proper techniques. During the searches, the civil police seized syringes and cell phones.
> 
> According to police chief Hugo Arruda, head of the Barreiro Specialized Homicide Police Station, investigations indicate that the transvestite, on the day of the facts, went to carry out the second procedure with the suspects. “The victim made a first application, with the same investigated, of 4 liters of industrial silicone. She would not have been satisfied with the result and requested a return to put another 2 liters of the product”, she says.
> 
> According to Arruda, none of the investigated has training to perform this type of procedure. “Both of them have only graduated from high school and have no qualification or course in biomedicine”, he notes, pointing out that the substance used “is a highly toxic product, used for cleaning aircraft parts, vehicles, tile sealing and waterproofing of glasses , without any indication for use in human beings”.
> 
> The investigative work points out that 38-year-old suspect industrial silicone to the victim's buttock with the help of the other investigated death, clandestinely and without the techniques required for the invasive procedure, resulting in the transvestite's.
> 
> After the victim experienced complications during the procedure, the Mobile Emergency Care Service (Samu) was called and she died on the same day. To try to deceive the investigations, the suspect reported in the police report that the victim was just recovering, at her house, from a procedure carried out in the state of Goiás. “They will answer for qualified homicide, illegal practice of medicine and for ideological falsehood [for providing false information in the record of the occurrence]”, said Arruda.
> 
> According to investigations, the suspect performed the illegal aesthetic procedure repeatedly. “It was mainly aimed at the transsexual, transfemale audience. He even had a full schedule, because the victim had difficulty scheduling the procedure,” says the delegate.
> 
> “The suspect charged between R$2,000 and R$3,000 for the anesthetic and application of the product. The product was purchased by victims/patients. And, to carry out the second procedure [on the transvestite], she would have charged R$900”, adds Arruda, noting that another case, which took place in June, is being investigated.
> 
> Also according to the delegate, the 38-year-old investigated has a history of crimes. “She has previous convictions for sexual exploitation of minors, homicide, threats, bodily harm, and also for running a prostitution point in Contagem, where she charged R$30”, he concludes. The suspects were sent to the prison system and are at the disposal of justice.
