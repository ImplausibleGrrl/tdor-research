> Trinidad Falcés, historical trans activist from A Coruña, prominent emblem of the LGTBI movement and anti-Francoist fighter, has died at the age of 80. The journalist Eva Mejuto, who recounted her memories in the book 'Diverse Memory', has shared the news on social networks : " Brave, funny, combative, stubborn and generous, in equal parts ".
> 
> Born in 1942 and baptized as Antonio, when she was eleven years old, she managed to get the Civil Registry of A Coruña to recognize her change of name to Trinidad in 1953, during the most belligerent period of the Franco dictatorship.
> 
> 'La Trini' was the daughter of a rapist who had abused her mother, she was born in the Church of Santiago, in the old city, according to the local newspaper Entrenós. She emigrated to Barcelona fleeing poverty, where she lived a large part of her life looking for a haven of freedom.
> 
> She was booked shortly after by the Francoist police. She said that she had " played the piano " when she was only fifteen years old. It was about some words used by those persecuted by the Franco regime in reference to taking fingerprints with ink on the cardboard of the police files.
> 
> Between the multiple arrests and sentences based on the law of vagrants and thugs, he spent five years in jail. Of them, five months in a concentration camp for homosexuals in Badajoz. This did not prevent him from always carrying in his bag a sheet of crumpled newspaper with the story of Marcela and Elisa , the two Galician women who were married in the church in 1901 pretending that one of them was a man.
> 
> Precisely, Marcela and Elisa give their name to the prize awarded annually by the Asociación pola Liberdade Afectiva e Sexual (ALAS) of A Coruña, and that in 2019 they gave her as an example of the fight for sexual integration and diversity. " For me this award means everything, because they have never given me anything in life. I have always seen myself very marginalized and very bad ," she said then.
> 
> In 1977 he led the first LGTBI Pride demonstration in Barcelona and continued to offer a " dissident and brave resistance against repression, jail, police abuse and the pointing out of a society that did not understand (and sometimes still does not understand) what was it comes out of the (supposed) noma(liad) ", Eva Mejuto posted on Facebook.
> 
> Tour of A Coruna
> Trinidad decided to return to A Coruña in the 1990s and in 2007 the Historical Memory Law officially recognized her as a victim of the dictatorship. " To visit 'La Trini' was to return with a mountain of gifts: rings, necklaces, clothes, books, souvenirs, gossip... All the belongings and memories that had been accumulated in a life full of experiences, adventures, several lives in a single one that she liked to share and remember, sometimes with bitterness, sometimes with nostalgia. 'Let them take away what I danced, I'll go through everything', was her header phrase ".
> 
> " Our memory is diverse and colorful, let's not forget who started our fight, with everything against us, we have a lot to learn from that generation. And everything to be thankful for. Thank you, Trini, may the earth be light to you. Wherever you are, do not forget that there are many people who loved and admired you. Let them take away what you danced, and everything happens! ", concludes the text.
