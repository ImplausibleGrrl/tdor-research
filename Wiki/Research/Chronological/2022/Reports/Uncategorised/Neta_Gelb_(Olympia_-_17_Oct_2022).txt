> Biography
> On October 17, 2022 we lost our beautiful talented child, Neta, nee Sabina, Gelb.  They were 24 years old, a musician, artist and writer who was deeply loved by their friends, their soulmate Nukté, parents Angela and Gary, Grandmother Helen and extended family.
> 
> Neta identified as non-binary trans and this was a huge part of their identity. Neta lived life on their own terms.  They travelled all over the United States and experienced a rich adulthood filled with music, friends and finding their own identity.  Neta had as we all do, times of sorrow, times of peace and times of joy.  This year they adopted an abused dog, named her Aileen and loved and cared for her so much that Aileen became peaceful and confident.
> 
> Recently, Neta began studying Judaism and adopted the name Neta, which means “seedling” in Hebrew.  They were deeply interested in gender identity and the Anarchist movement and not afraid of exploring new ideas and challenging the usual order of life.   Nukté, described Neta as someone who loved people “so hard”, and is grateful to Neta's family for raising a person who could love so deeply and loyally. Neta will be missed so very much.
