> Mérida, Yucatán, March 5, 2022.- The LGBTIQ+ community in Yucatán began 2022 with the unfortunate news of the death of Catalina de Córdoba Fonseca, her character was born for her work as an activist for the rights of the community and was recognized for being the Queen of Diversity Yucatan in 2019. Her partner, the King of Diversity, dedicates a few words to her:
> 
> “I have known him for years, in 2019 we were fortunate to represent Yucatán as Mister Gay and Queen of diversity, we had many experiences that year such as the carnival and the collection of signatures for equal marriage. I know that he was a dedicated and committed person, very talented, ingenious and optimistic, he always made me laugh with his witticisms, I take his great memory with me, he was a great human being, may God have him in his glory, we will keep him in our heart".
> 
> Catalina was present at two key events in the history of the LGBTIQ+ community in Yucatan. In 2019, the Mérida carnival included a contingent that celebrated diversity led by the kings of diversity and she was an important figure in this celebration, promoting the collection of signatures for the legalization of equal marriage, approved by the Yucatan Congress on 25 August 2021. As an artist, dance and folklore were important to her, she managed to be recognized for her concern for social causes and her way of expressing herself:
> 
> “Catalina always stood out for her studies in dance, folklore and combined it with her character Catalina, one of the photos that went viral was Jonathan Chi Dzul in a Veracruz dress and Catalina in a Veracruz dress; she uploaded videos dancing to some regional stamp from Hidalgo or Jalisco, she combined it with makeup and was quickly identified, then she began to venture into the show, I remember a representation of Ana Bárbara, very well represented ”.
> 
> This great event arrived, her coronation as queen of diversity, there were other qualified candidates, but she had a well-prepared speech, she knew what was happening at the national level and had a way with words, this made her Queen of Diversity together with Luis Abraham. This dumbbell was very good, they both looked good, they were the first people of diversity to enter the Mérida carnival, it was achieved thanks to Germán Pasos and Alfredo Candiani, who are no longer with us.
> 
> In 2019, it was very important: events, interviews, support for activities, we were on the eve of equal marriage. Catalina was a person who stood out, she opened the stage, she was the stellar host at Jorge's , it became a bar with more production for the community, the last time I saw her was in a very emotional show in memory of Alfredo Candiani. She had health complications and passed away.
> 
> Doña Lety, Catalina's mother, supported her, accompanied the pride marches and referred to him as an "exceptional son", his achievements are a merit of the support of his family and community that appreciated him so much. Among the awards she won are: Nuestra Belleza Mundo Gay 2016, Miss Universe Yucatan 2017, Miss Face Yucatan 2017, Queen of Carnival Blue 2018, Face Empire 2018. Her friend, Carlos Gómez, tells us how he remembers her:
> 
>  “I was fortunate to be with her in contests and disco shows, she was a very disciplined person, dedicated and willing to collaborate, she competed for CEGA in a national pageant called Miss Universe; she was Miss National Face and then she went to the national becoming Miss Mexico Face; In 2019 she decided to compete for Queen of Sexual Diversity and she was the winner, it was a busy year for her. I consider the relationships she had as an artistic education teacher important, that allowed her to carry the voice of the trans and transvestite community in the educational field, in addition to beauty pageants, she was very recognized and loved ”.
> 
> I remember it in her show in Blue, she sought to give more of herself, she perfected her wardrobe when she did the imitations, she also made her wardrobe; her dance skills were notorious on stage and she exploited it, she was responsible and delivered, willing to help in everything we asked of her, when she finished her reign she collaborated with the following kings. She was an important pillar in the virtuality of 2020, she is a key piece, she was crowned in the face-to-face event with the largest audience. Catalina is and will always be an important person in the middle. My respects and affection for her wherever she is."  
> 
> Carlos Gómez Castro, vice president of Rights, Culture and Sexual Diversity in Yucatán and organizer of beauty pageants.
> 
> We write this little tribute, in a place in Yucatán where Catalina inspired us with dedication, strength and taught us to fight for our dreams, we are proud of her, she lives in the memory of all who knew her and left a great legacy for future queens and activists who will raise their voices, open spaces for the rainbow community of Yucatán and defend our rights as Catalina, our queen, did. Rest in light.
