> From a very young age Daniel always showed an interest in Art. He later on in life nurtured his talents by attending the school CATA Central Academy of Theater and Arts. Once he graduated in 2017 he ventured out and embarked on his journey of going to NYC to pursue his dreams. He thrived in theater and his gift of creating beautiful artwork “masterpieces” which launched his journey to New York to attend Marymount Manhattan University, where he accomplished so much in such little time. Other aspirations included, but not limited to were free lance modeling, singing, and working on his own jewelry line. Daniel was full of passion and multitalented. He was extremely creative and passionate about all aspects of life. To know Daniel is to love him, and to feel his vibrant spirit. Daniel was an exceptionally beautiful soul with an even more beautiful loving spirit who loved his family & friends "chosen family" more than life itself. Daniel was always willing to help any one in need even if it was just lending a listening ear. Anyone who ever had the privilege to cross Daniel's path left knowing what it meant to feel authentic genuine compassion and unconditional love. Daniel was true to who he was. He lived his life unapologetically and that made him even more lovable. Daniel will forever be remembered, respected and loved for the beautiful angelic soul that he was. In the physical sense he may be gone, but in the spirit he will ALWAYS live on in the hearts of everyone who loved him.

> In the words of Daniel, “Give what you can and if all you have is love, that might be the thing that saves somebody's life.”
