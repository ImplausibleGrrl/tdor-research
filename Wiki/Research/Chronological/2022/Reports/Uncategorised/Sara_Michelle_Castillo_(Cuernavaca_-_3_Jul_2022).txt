> Regarding said act of violence, local deputy Roberto Yáñez Moreno, representative of Sexual Diversity in the Morelos Congress, issued the following statement:
> 
> "Unfortunately, this morning a 'young woman' appeared lifeless on Plan de Ayala street, her name was Sara Michelle Castillo, she was a TRANS girl, who, as everyone knows, is cowardly violated and in extreme cases until they take their lives.
> 
> Just on Wednesday I commented on the platform how difficult it has been for the TRANS community to make themselves visible without fear of being violated, today we suffer again from this cancer of hatred towards our community.
> 
> Regardless of the positions that I will make on the platform, I ask you to refer to her as a "trans girl" since the gender identity that she lived day by day was that of a happy and free woman who could choose and enjoy her sexuality.
> 
> I tell you that since there is still no figure such as "hate crime" typified towards sexual diversity, it will have to be classified as femicide, and that should be the line of investigation.
> 
> I appreciate your attention, and let's avoid revictimizing the young woman whose life was taken, good afternoon
> 
> I am not going into the way he lost his life, that would be up to the authorities. I only ask that you refer to her as a 'trans girl' thank you ».
