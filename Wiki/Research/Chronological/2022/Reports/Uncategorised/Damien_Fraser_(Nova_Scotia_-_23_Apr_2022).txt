> The missing persons release from Cape Breton Regional Police was posted to their Facebook page and sent to media using Fraser's former name and pronouns. It also included an older photo. 
> 
> As the media coverage, including in the Cape Breton Post, and social media posting was shared, some people shared screenshots of Fraser's coming-out post. 
> 
> "He is the kindest, most understanding person you’ll meet. You can talk to him with absolutely no judgment. Just an overall lovely person." — Fraser's former neighbour Kayla MacDonald
> 
> Police updated the information to reflect both names, as complaints were voiced through social media about the misgendering of the missing man. 
> 
> "Police identify individuals – including name and other descriptive characteristics – based on the information told to us. In this case, the information police released is what was originally and continues to be given to us by the individual’s next of kin, the family. Any updates were and will be based on information provided to us and confirmed by family. We are unable to speak to the individual directly to obtain or confirm any information," said Magnus, in a written response to emailed questions. 
> 
> "We absolutely respect and acknowledge every individual’s right to choose what name and pronouns they tell us they want to be called by, and it has always been our practice to name them accordingly, based on what we are told."
> 
> The Cape Breton Post and Saltwire Network also published an article using the incorrect information as it is standard for media to use what has been provided by police as an official source. 
> 
> Transgender rights advocate Veronica Merryfield said she was "disappointed but not surprised" to see the misgendering in the Post and police social media, as well as how it was handled. 
> 
> "Often the media get these kind of things wrong or the police get these kind of things wrong with somebody newly transitioning," said Merryfield, who is an intersex trans woman. 
> 
> "It seemed like his gender and pronouns were an afterthought with older pictures that didn't really reflect who he was." 
> 
> Over decades of working with transgender people and going through her own mental health journey during her transition more than 30 years ago, Merryfield has seen what negative impacts misgendering can have; including running away and self-harm. 
> 
> "The misuse of pronouns and deadnames is a big factor in suicides (in the trans community)," said Merryfield, who doesn't personally know Fraser.
> 
> "Studies have shown suicides decrease by 65 per cent simply by the correct use of the name or pronoun."  
> 
> Cape Breton Youth Project co-ordinator and 2SLGBTQ+ educator Madonna Doucette has experience working with transgender youth as well as their families. 
> 
> She felt some of the criticism about the misgendering in the missing person release distracted from the search for Fraser. 
> 
> "Vilifying the parents and the police and building a soapbox to climb up on and start ranting about gender identity and pronouns, this is not the right time or right focus," 
> 
> "Parents when they find out when their kids are trans they have a period of adjustment they have to make. There's a grieving that happens, so I think it's unhealthy to assume the parents are bad … It's distracting from the fact that this child is missing." 
> 
> "We absolutely respect and acknowledge every individual’s right to choose what name and pronouns they tell us they want to be called by, and it has always been our practice to name them accordingly, based on what we are told." — Desiree Magnus, Cape Breton Regional Police
> 
> Doucette points out not all trans men look the same and not all transitions are similar and there are many facts not known about Fraser's situation; such as if the Sydney Mines man was out to his parents and family. 
> 
> Whatever the situation surrounding Fraser's disappearance, Doucette and Merryfield both want him to know there are supports through the 2SLGBTQ+ community in Cape Breton and off-island. 
> 
> "Let's keep correcting (pronouns and name) going forward, to get a good message out there that this person is important, they are worthy and they are so deserving to be loved," said Doucette. 
> 
> "And bring him home."
> 
> Fraser has shoulder-length dark hair and glasses. He was last seen wearing blue jeans, a black and white striped shirt, a black jacket and black sneakers with white laces. Anyone with information is asked to call police at 902-563-5151 or anonymously through Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477.
