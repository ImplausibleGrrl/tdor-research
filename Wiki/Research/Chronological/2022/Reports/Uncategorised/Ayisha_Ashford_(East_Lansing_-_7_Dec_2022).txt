Staff member of [Her Power, Her Pride](https://www.facebook.com/HerPowerHerPride/).

> "Her Power! Her Pride! is an annual event for high school girls with disabilities in Michigan. This event uses accessible art techniques because of their universal ability for any girl to express herself. This four-day event holds conversations around media to help girls explore their multiple identities. Talking about media is a perfect tool to dive into topics essential to building confidence."




> Her Power! Her Pride! Is devastated to let our community know we lost one of our own. Staff member Ayisha passed away. They were our rock. Loved dearly by all staff and participants. As we process our grief we want you to know we are so sorry if this reaches you unexpectedly. Her Power will share how we will reflect and honor their life as a community in the near future. 
> Ayisha we love you.



> From Today's Celebration of Life....
> "I am so sad that we are gathering today because we lost one of our own. Our Ayisha. 
> Ayisha started coming to Her Power! Her Pride! As a participant in 2011, accompanied by their partner in crime, Iesha. Over the years, they turned from participant to staff member. Showing up each year with an infectious smile and a determination to give the girls who attended a great time.  Even when they (Ayisha) were extremely tired. 
> 
> Ayisha had big plans to move into their own place and Her Power! Had big plans to expand our programs to middle school girls. The loss of Ayisha has knocked all of us back. 
> I have read a lot of articles about how you should not call coworkers or volunteers a family. The authors have a list of reasons for how this can cause disruption in the process. But the truth is Her Power! is a family. We grow and learn from each other. We are a community that has, for some of us, known each other for over a decade or more. We have seen our Her Power! family have children, get married, get divorced, challenge our biological families for independence, and challenge friends and family based on things we learned at Her Power! We have seen our Her Power! Family find themselves, find our identities, including gender and sexual orientation, and find pride, and find sooo much pride. 
> 
> Ayisha was part of all of this. They were an essential part of who we are. They will be missed, and their death will forever change the fabric of the Her Power experience for us here today. 
> 
> This will be a change, but they will always be here. They are part of what has built Her Power! How we move at Her power! What we do and how we interact are built on the memories, lessons, and passion of our staff, including Ayisha. So they are never gone. 
> 
> I have a poem for us specifically for our Her Power Family; before I read the poem, I hope you will imagine yourself at Her Power physically at the camp. In the calm, before the participants arrive, and as I read the poem, remember Ayisha is with us and will never be forgotten. "

> It is with a heavy heart that I relay that Ms. Ayisha Ashford, the daughter of long-time neighbors Phillis and Donald Ashford, passed away recently. Ayisha was 26 years old and died after a battle with cancer. She was a vibrant spirit and loved by all her had the honor of knowing her. She was Phillis' and Donald's only child together. Although the family moved away from North Rosedale Park several years ago, they lived on our Rosemont block for many years and were active in the community.
