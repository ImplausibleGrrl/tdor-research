> 
> DCF Secretary Laura Howard told The Star: "My deepest condolences to everyone who knew and loved Ace: family, friends, and everyone who had the opportunity to know and care about him. My hope is that memories of Ace provide comfort during this difficult time.
> 
> “Also know that DCF is taking every step at its disposal to better understand the circumstances of this case and identify the types of services or supports that could prevent a tragedy like this from happening in the future.”
> 
> Scott, a transgender man, had spent most of his final weeks hospitalized for a "known medical condition," according to DCF officials. He entered on March 26.
>

> 
> The day he was released from the hospital, Scott ran away from a Cornerstones of Care office. He had been waiting for a new location that day, reports The Star.

> 
> A cause of death has not yet been released and his death is still being investigated, according to Kansas City police.
