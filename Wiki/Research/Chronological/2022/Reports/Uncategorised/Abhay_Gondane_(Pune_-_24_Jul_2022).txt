> Pune hotel transgender death case: Bombay HC grants relief to hotelier's wife | Representative Image
> Follow us on
> Mumbai: Observing that “prima facie it cannot be said to be an offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder”, the Bombay High Court granted pre-arrest bail to the wife of the Pune hotelier in whose premises a transgender was found dead last year. 
> 
> How the incident unfolded
> 
> On July 24, 2022, a party was organised by the Mist Foundation (that works among the transgenders) at the Bar Heist Hotel in Wakad, Pune. Around 7pm, transgenders Manoj Goilkar and Abhay Gondane entered the bar. They consumed some liquor and went to the dance floor. Between 1 and 1.30 am, Goilkar had an altercation with another transgender.
> 
> Hotel owner Anurag Gole, his wife Sejal and hotel manager – who are accused in the case – intervened in the quarrel. Gondane was furious as they were driven out of the hotel. Both of them were hit by the accused and a bartender and bouncer as Gondane confronted the hotelier.
> 
> According to Goilkar, Gondane ran out of the hotel and was later found in a pool of blood. He was rushed to a hospital, but succumbed to his injuries. 
> 
> Ms Gole’s Advocate Satyavrat Joshi pointed out the statements of two witnesses to the court who said that it was Goilkar who first assaulted and “entered into a verbal acrobat” with the owner, manager and bouncer of the hotel.
> 
> Judge: 'Deceased triggered the melee..'
> 
> After going through the charge-sheet, Justice Prithviraj Chavan noted, “It clearly indicates that it was the deceased who triggered the melee and was the aggressor at the relevant time. It appears that when the hotel owner, manager and Sejal Gole tried to argue, the deceased himself, out of fear, tried to escape, and in that process jumped off from the second floor, resulting in the death.”
> 
> Granting relief to Mrs Gole, the court also noted that other accused were arrested and released on bail.



> Transphobic Incident! 22-Yr-Old Transman Jumps To Death From Hotel At Queer Party, Investigation Underway
> Maharashtra,  29 July 2022 7:39 AM
> 
> In a recent incident at Wakad, Pune, a 22-year-old transman died after jumping from the second floor of a hotel after escaping the bouncers who were beating him up. Wakad police have so far arrested five people in the case.
> In a recent tragic incident at Wakad, Pune, a 22-year-old transman died after jumping from the second floor of a hotel after escaping the bouncers who were beating him up. The incident occurred at The Bar Heist Hotel on Sunday (July 24), where the deceased transman Abhay Gondane and his friend Mannat Shaikh were attending the party.
> 
> The party was organised by the Mist LGBT Foundation- a city-based non-profit organisation that aims to empower the LGBTQIA community, reported The Quint. The complainant in the case, Shaikh, said she was held inside the bar, and the bouncers outside the bar gate beat up his friend.
> 
> What Was The Matter?
> The agitation and violence inside the bar started when the bar owner asked Shaikh to dance on a table. According to Shaikh, the owner seemed to have a problem with transgender. But she did whatever he said to teach him a lesson while her friend Gondane interrupted and asked her to back off.
> 
> Suddenly, there was an uncontrollable situation, and the bouncer started hitting both of them. Gondane tried to escape the bouncers attacking him and jumped from the window.
> 
> Shaikh added, "I fell to the floor and went unconscious. It was very late until I came back to my mind and realised that Gondane was drenched in blood, lying on the floor. Nobody came to help for two hours, the police officials also confirmed after seeing the CCTV footage."
> 
> Accused Booked
> The Wakad Police have registered cases under sections 304 (ii), 326, 323, 324, 334, 148, and 149 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). So far, five people accused of instigating the incident have been arrested, including the hotel owner, Anurag Gole, manager Ganjana Namdev, bartender Robule Awwal, bouncer Ashutosh Sanjay Manmudale, and DJ Ganesh Prakash Daga.
> 
> Shaikh, who identifies as a transwoman, said, "Community members do not feel safe everywhere. That is why we go to parties organised by community members, thinking it will be a safe space for us. No one picked up the phone to call the cops or the ambulance. If that was done, today Gondane would have been with me."
> 
> The residents, out of agitation, asked, "When did the brawl start, and why did not anyone call the police at that very moment? It could have saved a life".
> After five people had been arrested, the police continued the investigation to unfold the remaining case angles.



> At about 10:30 pm on Sunday, 24 July, Abhay Gondane and his friend Mannat Shaikh went to 'The Bar Heist' in Pune's Wakad area, to attend a party organised by Mist LGBT Foundation, a city-based organisation that aims to 'empower' LGBTQIA community.
> 
> In the next four hours, 21-year-old Gondane, known among his friends as Shrey, died after jumping from the second floor of the building as he tried to escape the bar's bouncers who were allegedly assaulting his friend and him.
> 
> The Wakad Police have registered a case under Sections 307 (attempt to murder), 326 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means), 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 143 (whoever is a member of an unlawful assembly), 148 (rioting, armed with a deadly weapon) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against the owner and bouncers of the restobar.
> 
> The police have so far arrested five people in connection with the incident – owner of the restobar Anurag Gole (29), manager Gajanan Kharat (33), bouncers Ashutosh Sanjay (31) and Robule Awal (21), and DJ Ganesh Daga (27). No action has been taken against the organisers – Mist LGBT Foundation – yet.
> "Members of the community do not feel safe everywhere. That is the reason we go to parties organised by members of the community, thinking it will be a safe space for us. No one even picked the phone to call the cops or the ambulance. If that was done, today Shrey would have been with me," 24-year-old Shaikh, who identifies as a trans woman, told The Quint.
> 
> According to Shaikh, the brawl allegedly started when the owner of the restobar Anurag Gole asked her to dance on the bar table.
> 
> "The owner seemed to have a problem with transgender persons. He was mocking me, and when he asked me to dance on the table, I did it just to teach him a lesson. But his wife asked me to get down, and there was a small altercation. When he did the same again, Shrey asked him to back off. Suddenly, there was uncontrollable chaos. The bouncers started hitting both of us, glasses were broken, and we were hit. Chairs were thrown at us," Shaikh said.
> 
> "I saw Shrey running out, before I became unconscious. That was the last time I ever saw him. When I woke up, the bar was almost empty. I thought he must have escaped, imagine my shock when I saw him lying in a pool of bed almost half hour later," Shaikh added.
> 
> Speaking to The Quint, two eyewitnesses, who did not want to be named, corroborated the events.
> 
> "The bouncers were hitting him with a chair, and he just wanted to escape. When there was no other way, he had to jump to escape but as he hit the ground, he was injured badly. He was lying in a pool of blood. But no one went to help him, not even the organiser. Everyone was planning their exit," an eyewitness told The Quint.
> 'Not Trying to Hide Anything': MIST Co-Founder
> Speaking to The Quint, Shyam, co-founder of Mist LGBT Foundation, said that his organisation is not trying to hide anything, and that they will extend full support to Shaikh.
> 
> "I was not at the event that day. From what I have heard, the situation escalated very quickly in light of the back and forth between Shrey and the bar staff. We have a young team – and one of our members had a panic attack due to the chaos. We agree that we did not react immediately like we should have, we are not trying to hide it," Shyam said.
> The Quint has reached out The Bar Heist. The article will be updated with their response.
