> The week started with a terrible loss on Saturday, July 16, in Milwaukee where 34-year-old Toi Davis, a Black trans woman, was found dead in a local neighborhood under suspicious circumstances. Details around her death are not clear at this point, but the impact of her death among her friends and family leave little doubt about how much Toi was loved. Toi was a Certified Nursing Assistant. She enjoyed cooking. She had many friends and family members.
> 
> Toi was a member of the Sisters Helping Each Other Battle Adversity, profiled in a recent series highlighting Black trans women. They wrote that “Toi is a black women of trans experience, she always knew she was different” Toi expressed the pressure she felt to conform with cisgender hetero normative expectations. “My transition has saved my life.” And she professed her faith, that she believed she was on a path as a woman that was created by God.
