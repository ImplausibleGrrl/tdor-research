> The strange and silenced death of Cristina Rodríguez Yáñez, an icon of the trans fight, in a supervised apartment in Madrid
> Cristina Rodríguez Yáñez died between October 19 and 20, 2022. Almost a month after her death, few people who knew her have learned of her death. Silence has enveloped the case during all this time in which the memory and trajectory of one of the pioneers in the fight for visibility and against the stigma of transsexual people during the dictatorship and the Transition has not even been remembered.
> 
> Yáñez, 72 years old and a native of Isla Cristina (Huelva), had been living for several years in one of the more than one hundred supervised apartments for the elderly that the Community of Madrid has in Torrejón de Ardoz. When they found her lifeless body, there were a few days left before she had to leave that house, in which she died for unknown reasons and completely alone, several sources consulted confirm to Público that they knew the deceased and prefer to maintain the anonymity of she.
> 
> The same sources emphasize the little publicity that has been given and the "strange circumstances" of his death, which occurred after several problems with the management of the flats and a few days before he had to leave the apartment. In fact, as a consequence of this situation, staff from the Community of Madrid contacted the 26 de Diciembre Foundation, which also manages apartments for LGTBIQ + elderly people, given the imminent departure of Yáñez from the Torrejón sheltered apartments, managed by the company CLECE .
> 
> Público has not been able to obtain the version of the management of the supervised flats at the close of this article, although it has been able to confirm from different sources that Yáñez was going to be expelled after several problems with the management.
> 
> Although Cristina Rodríguez Yáñez was known and loved by the LGTBI community , there are many who have been surprised to learn of her death after several weeks. In several cases, the news has reached them through questions in this newspaper. This is the case of Carla Antonelli , a former deputy of the PSOE in the Community of Madrid, also a reference in the fight for the rights of transsexual people and a friend of the deceased.
> 
> According to Público Antonelli, Rodríguez Yáñez was one of the first trans people she met when she arrived in Madrid in the 1970s and who helped her find accommodation in those dark and dangerous years for the then fledgling LGTBI community. She declares herself surprised with the death and, above all, with the little information that she has provided.
> 
> The deceased had no social networks and there is hardly any information about her life on the Internet. One of her few documents about her past is in the documentary about Antonelli's life, El viaje de Carla , directed in 2014 by Fernando Olmeda.
> 
> En este filme, Rodríguez Yáñez recuerda cómo conoció a Antonelli en aquel Madrid que comenzaba a vender el morbo del transformismo en los clubes y salas de fiesta, al mismo tiempo que la franquista Ley de Peligrosidad y Rehabilitación Social, heredera de la Ley de Vagos y Maleantes, servía para reprimir salvajemente a las personas LGTBI.
> 
> "Yo soy una personas muy echada para adelante y, en esos momentos, cuando encontrabas a alguien como tú era como encontrar una isla cuando te estás ahogando", asegura Yáñez en el documental. Su historia es la de una pelea constante contra el tiempo, los prejuicios, el señalamiento y el ostracismo social. Antes de emigrar a la capital, Yáñez trabajó como albañil e incluso en el campo onubense recogiendo fresas. Después, en Madrid, compartió escenario con grandes artistas de la época en diferentes salas de fiesta, donde solía cantar copla.

> "En las salas de fiesta no les interesaba que tú cantaras muy bien, sino que dieras una imagen de mujer sexy para que luego dijeran: Pues no es una mujer; ahí estaba el morbo", explicaba Rodríguez Yáñez es esta película. "En la sala de fiesta, la figura éramos nosotras. Aquí estoy protegida, pensabas. La gente te aplaudía y te decía guapa. Era gloria. Luego, a lo mejor al salir, cogían y te detenían. Si ibas maquillada de una sala a otro garito y te veía la Policía, te detenía", abundaba.
> 
> In fact, Yáñez went through the police station on several occasions. In 2018, the deceased she received a special mention at the Madrid Woman's Week Foundation International Awards. The entity valued the "activism in pursuit of normalization led by Cristina Rodríguez Yáñez", who fought for "the gender identity law to be approved", and recalled that Rodríguez Yáñez "was one of the first to take to the streets to defend LGTBI rights, suffering great police repression, being detained on several occasions, under the law of social danger".
