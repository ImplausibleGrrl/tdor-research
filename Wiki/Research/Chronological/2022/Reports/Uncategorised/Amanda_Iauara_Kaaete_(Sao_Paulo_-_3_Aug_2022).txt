We sincerely ask for financial help to cover the transport of the body and funeral expenses so that our eternal Iauara Ka'eté may rest in peace.




> I feel obliged to say that every time I think of the name "Kaeté" my heart is filled with bitterness and grief, and I hope that with my humble words I can demonstrate the reason why I see so much soul, so much pain and so much beauty in history of that people. If not, I am content to show you just a tiny fragment of them, in the impossibility of keeping such passions and pains inside me.
> 
> "Kaeté" is an ethnic identity that has lost its people. I am a person who has lost his ethnic identity. From this double need, as a native of the place once inhabited by the Kaeté, I (re)emerge as an indigenous person, while the Kaeté in me rediscover their expression and life. But who were these fantastic people?
> 
> The name Kaeté (variants Caeté, Caheté, Caetés, Cahetés) comes from the Old Tupi (Tupinamba language, the Tupi of the eastern coast) ka'a , "bush, leaf, forest" and the suffix eté , which designates great intensity (and in some cases quantity), perhaps forming an original ethnonym * ka'a-eté . The Kaeté inhabited the Atlantic coast between the Paraíba and São Francisco rivers (lat. 8°-ir S., long. 36° W.) according to Métraux (1948: 96) and Hemming (1978: 82-83) . This is equivalent to saying that "the Kaeté would settle from São Francisco to the north, as far as the vicinity of Itamaracá" (Dantas, Sampaio and Carvalho, 1992: 437). This territory corresponds, roughly, to the south of the current state of Pernambuco and the territory of Alagoas.
> 
> They would have arrived there between about 800 and 1,000 AD, if we consider the model of migrations in the form of a "pincer" of the Tupi-Guarani proposed by Brochado (Fausto, 1992: 384), in which the Tupi come from the north coast of Brazil to from the Upper Amazon.
> 
> It is estimated that in the 16th century, from São Francisco to Sergipe there were (approximately) 50,000 people and in C. Sto Agostinho, 25,000, totaling about 75,000 Kaeté (Hemming, 1978: 496).
> They were a Tupi-speaking people, and due to their coastal location, they can be classified under the Tupinambá group (Fausto, 1992: 383; Cunha e Castro, 1985: 57; Métraux, 1979: XXXIII), used here as a generic term and nonspecific.
> 
> And that is almost all that is known of "good" about these people. The few remaining memories of the Kaeté are soaked in a lot of blood.
