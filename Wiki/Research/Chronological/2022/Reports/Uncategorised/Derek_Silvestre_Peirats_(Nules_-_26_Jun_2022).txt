> Nules mourns the loss of Derek, a 22-year-old who lost his life this Sunday morning after a life of struggle for his transsexuality. DAVID GARCIA
> 
>  “Derek was the kindest, nicest person in the world. He was always happy”. Who speaks like this about the 22-year-old who died early this Sunday in Nules is Jordi Pilar, president of Castelló LGTBI . This same Saturday they were together in an act of the association held in Vinaròs and today they planned to go back to the same point. “ It is not an isolated case. We know that it can happen at any time and the reason is none other than internalized transphobia in society. That has killed him ”, confesses Jordi.
> 
> Consternation, pain, anger and sorrow come together this Sunday in Nules, especially among those who knew a young man who was always clear that she was a woman trapped in a man's body. Her struggle served as an example for many and barely a year ago she saw fit to expose her case in this newspaper to illustrate the multiple setbacks that transsexuals must suffer today. “I do not consider that she was ever a girl. I am trans because I was assigned another gender that I do not identify with. But she is one more body, ”she says in an interview that you can read below from barely a year ago.
> 
> Jordi Pilar adds that the suicide rate among trans people “ is a hidden reality. Most of the aggressions come from themselves ”, and he trusts that society becomes aware of a problem that associations such as Castelló LGTBI, which he presides over, have been boldly denouncing.

> Derek was a much loved and appreciated person at Nules. In fact this Tuesday at 12 noon he planned to participate in the reading in the Plaza Mayor of the manifesto on the occasion of Pride Day . He will no longer be able to do it and the mayor himself, David García, regrets it with these words: "There are many people like Derek and his case has to give us the strength to continue fighting for them." The first mayor of the town was also 'touched' on a personal level: “I knew him well because he lived in my neighborhood and we went to the same school. He had a job, he was very integrated and he was very loved. He had overcome many obstacles to get where he was and this is a very hard blow”.
> 
> David García assures that "today it makes more sense than ever to fight for diversity and justice so that lives like Derek's are easier than his ."
