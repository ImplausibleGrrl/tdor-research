> 
> This is due to the fact that the Consulate requested the direct intervention of the federal authority, for which the State Prosecutor's Office only protects the body, of which for months it has delivered the DNA samples to be compared with those of the Topón Huiracocha family.

And (that) it is a very delayed case, and that after that to repatriate the body. That's what the Mexican prosecutor told me, so I'm waiting. Here in Ecuador they tell me that we have to wait for what they say about Mexico”, he narrated.
