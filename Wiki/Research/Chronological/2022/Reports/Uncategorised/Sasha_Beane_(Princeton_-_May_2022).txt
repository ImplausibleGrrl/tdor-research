> A little over two weeks ago, we unexpectedly lost my younger cousin Sasha. Trying to find the words to commemorate her have been incredibly difficult, but the last thing I want is for her passing to result in avoiding the tough conversations that coincide with grief. A month before her passing, Sasha came out as transgender, and I admire her so much for embracing her true self. The stigma and negativity surrounding both the transgender and neurodivergent communities is something that should be actively challenged. You never know what someone is going through, and loving each other without judgement is essential. Tell the people you love that you love them, and don’t take the time we have together in this life for granted. The memories I have of growing up together with Sasha I will hold in my heart forever. I hope she’s at peace now wherever she is.
