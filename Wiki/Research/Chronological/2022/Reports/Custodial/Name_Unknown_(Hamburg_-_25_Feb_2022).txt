> Two weeks ago it became known that a transgender woman who had been imprisoned in Hamburg's Fuhlsbüttel men's prison had already taken her own life in February. According to the report in the "Bild" newspaper, the 52-year-old was allowed to wear female clothing in everyday prison life. However, she was exposed to massive bullying by fellow inmates ( queer.de reported ).
> 
> At the time, there was also criticism of Justice Senator Anna Galina and her house's information policy. In an interview, the Green politician explains the situation further and announces a reform of the enforcement.
> 
> "Bild" reported on March 8 that a transgender woman took her own life in the men's prison in Fuhlsbüttel. You are not allowed to comment on personal details, but this is simply the gender of the deceased. Can you confirm the dead woman was transgender?
> 
> Yes, the deceased was transgender. We were accused of deliberately concealing it. It's not like that. We have a transparent but also sensitive procedure because it is also about protecting the privacy of the deceased.
> 
> After a suicide, we inform the relatives and the responsible members of the state parliament. Every suicide is processed with the participation of external experts, we look at the circumstances meticulously and analyze what consequences we may have to draw for the processes in the penal system and then implement them.
> 
> The Judiciary Committee is having a chat about the case. We must always carefully consider what information we can share and when. This does not always satisfy the ad hoc information needs of the media and the public. However, I consider the protection of personal rights to be a valuable asset.
> 
> As was partially reported about this case, it has been shown that by no means all of them were concerned with the interests and needs of trans people in prison. In the past I have made it very clear that the unspeakable transsexual law must be replaced by a self-determination law.
> 
> Many did not like that and some people sensed the chance of a scandal in connection with this suicide because of the insinuation that we would not support trans people in prison. Incidentally, something like that comes from the camp that is far removed from the political support of trans rights.
> 
> According to the law, what role does gender currently play in Hamburg when it comes to assignment to prisons? And how is this handled in practice?
> 
> The vast majority of prison laws, including those in Hamburg, currently only differentiate between the genders "man" and "woman". These are to be accommodated in separate institutions or departments. There is still a need for regulation nationwide when dealing with transgender and intersex as well as non-binary people.
> 
> We will create a legally secure basis for everyday prison life in Hamburg. That is why we are working on adapting the state enforcement laws and want to introduce the changes to the law in the spring or summer of this year.
> 
> Experiences from prisons as well as external expertise are incorporated here. But that doesn't mean that we only proceed schematically. That's not allowed. And I would like to emphasize this once again: the individual history of each person in prison already plays a major role. The experts consult with each other and the detainee is closely followed. It's about finding a good solution together with the inmate.
> 
> It is possible to transfer to the other type of execution as soon as the transition process begins. The process is then closely monitored by the institutions. There is expert advice from social work, medicine, psychiatry and pastoral care and organizational support, for example when applying for a change in marital status or the use of special clothing. The people involved really care.
> 
> In Berlin it has been possible since last year to hear prisoners being assigned to a prison ( queer.de reported ) . Not only the civil status is then decisive, but also the actual gender of a person. In the end, however, it remains a discretionary decision, there is no legal entitlement. A model for Hamburg?
> 
> Of course, we take a very close look at how the processes in the Berlin prison are going. It is important to me that we fundamentally work out the necessary adjustments in prison and continue to implement them in the prison laws and in everyday work in prison. We want good rules.
> 
> But once again: Individual interviews are already being held in Hamburg when the inmates are admitted and accommodated. The extent to which we can adopt further points from Berlin is also the subject of a working group in my office. The goal is a set of guidelines for the admission of transgender people into detention, which also specifies supportive and protective measures for the further course of detention, defines processes and responsibilities, further expands the training program for employees and provides for cooperation with external advice centers.
> 
> The previous experiences of the institutions are taken into account and interdisciplinary expertise from outside is included. In the Hamburg correctional system, for example, there is specific training provided by the Magnus Hirschfeld Center.
> 
> What scope for change do you see in Hamburg in order to better weigh up and guarantee the security interests of all those involved, including transgender and intersex prisoners?
> 
> Security is, of course, an important consideration in all prison considerations. We must support and protect our detainees. The educational work carried out in the areas of further education and training on the subject of diversity, gender and sexual orientation also makes a major contribution to this.
> 
> But human dignity sets clear limits here. Absolute security cannot exist even within prison, because that would entail unacceptable restrictions on the rights of each individual. Specifically: We must not, cannot and do not want to monitor every person completely.
> 
> In Hamburg we have a very progressive rehabilitation law. It is about the reintegration of the individual into society and about care and support. This ties in with what I said earlier: individual needs must be the focus as soon as a person is admitted to prison.
> 
> The individual orientation of the penal system to the needs of each individual from the very first minute is the key to successful reintegration. Everyone deserves the same respect. This will continue to be the basis of our efforts. At the same time, of course, we are constantly looking to see where we can improve in these areas of the penal system






> Trans woman hangs herself in men's prison
> The main portal of the Fuhlsbüttel correctional facility
> 
> Hamburg – The case is terrible – and it raises sensitive questions for Justice Senator Anna Gallina (38, Greens).
> 
> 
> According to BILD information, a trans woman (52) committed suicide by hanging in the notorious "Santa Fu" male prison, the JVA Fuhlsbüttel (around 800 inmates).
> 
> Possibly because the person who feels like a woman and wants to live as such has been subjected to bullying and discrimination by other prisoners.
> 
> The judiciary only confirms that there was "one death" on Friday 25 February.
> 
> There's a lot to be said for suicide. Investigations have been initiated. The authority is silent on the gender identity of the victim and retreats to "post-mortem protection of personality".
> 
> The trans woman has been in prison for assault and insult since August 2021.
> 
> 
> Apparently she wore mostly women's clothes and dyed her hair whenever possible. It is unclear whether an application for gender reassignment surgery had already been made.
> 
> A letter from a fellow prisoner (available to BILD) states that the trans woman "had a very difficult life here in the institution (...) because she was massively bullied".
> 
> The Gallina authority does not contribute to the clarification. None of the further BILD questions about the tragic case were answered. Neither about possible discrimination, nor about whether the trans woman could have been transferred, nor about whether there are general instructions on how to proceed in such cases.
