> BY ACTION OF THE CPM SHE HAD BEEN TAKEN TO A HOSPITALA trans woman detained in Alcaidía 44 of Batán died due to unattended health problems
> July 28, 2022
> 
> Gender violence, apathy, abandonment of the prison health system and the inaction of justice caused the death of Sasha Barrionuevo, 38 years old. Despite the fact that she suffered from chronic pain, a sudden loss of 30 kilos of weight and fatigue, among other symptoms, the health doctors of the Mayor's Office of Mar del Plata decreed -without reviewing or treating her- that it was a simulation and did not take into account serious deterioration of his health. It was only when the Provincial Commission for Memory, in its capacity as the Local Mechanism for the Prevention of Torture, presented a habeas corpus petition that she was transferred to the Oscar Alende Hospital. There, in breach of the gender law, she was registered with a male name.
> 
> (Agency) Sasha Barrionuevo passed away on July 20 at the Oscar Alende General Interzonal Acute Hospital (HIGA) in Mar del Plata, but the news was not communicated to the departmental Oral Criminal Court 3, which was handling her case, nor to her public defend. Both judicial agencies stated that they had learned of his death from what was reported by telephone by the CPM almost a week later, on July 26. Indeed, that same July 26, members of the CPM Atlantic delegation team were present at the hospital to meet again with Sasha, whose case had been monitored and judicially accompanied by virtue of the systematic and arbitrary denial of access to the health care suffered in Alcaidía 44 of Batán, where she had been housed.
> 
> The same day of his death, the TOC 3 of Mar del Plata had ordered the release of Sasha from preventive detention. In this decision they took refuge from the penitentiary mayor to try to justify why they had not given her death notice of her. What they stated was that since the pre-trial detention had ended, the prison staff had left the hospital and for this reason they did not report in a timely manner.
> 
> Beyond chance and paradoxes, this data constitutes a central element of the sufferings to which trans people are subjected in confinement. While the pretrial detention rate for men in prison amounts to 54% in 2021, for trans people that percentage rises above 70%. (see more information Trans and transvestites imprisoned )
> 
> Sasha suffered from serious health problems that were not treated and, for this reason, also not diagnosed. In a short period of time she had lost 30 kilos and was systematically denied the medical care she requested. Among other ailments, she indicated loss of vision, vomiting, dizziness, episodes of very low blood pressure and fatigue. She even required many times the assistance of her companions de ella -she was housed in the trans pavilion- hers de ella to be able to move around and carry out her daily tasks.
> 
> Since the CPM became aware of Sasha's case during a monitoring inspection in Mar del Plata, the health sector of Alcaidía 44 was requested to provide her with immediate medical attention due to her serious health condition. But the response obtained from the health professionals was that they did not believe that she felt so bad and that she constantly feigned illness.
> 
> The last time the CPM interviewed her in her place of detention, and due to the seriousness and deterioration observed in Sasha's state of health, a habeas corpus petition was filed requesting her immediate medical attention in an extramural hospital. Her transfer order from her finally arrived on July 12, after several days of intense suffering. She was transferred to the local HIGA and there she remained hospitalized in a very serious condition until July 20, when she died.
> 
> The CPM had been accompanying Sasha and making requests to the court in charge since 2021, when they interviewed her for the first time in Florencio Varela's UP 34.
> 
> The case not only expresses the brutality and penitentiary, judicial and medical negligence towards detainees whose integrity must be ensured by the different agencies of the penal system, but also the persistence of this type of abandonment that leads, in many cases, to avoidable deaths or situations in which the lives of the victims are not necessarily at risk.
> 
> Added to the gender violence suffered by Sasha is the dehumanization of doctors who disbelieve in suffering despite the clear manifestations in the victim's body and the anguish caused by knowing that her health worsens knowing that she will not be treated. This suffering constitutes torture and mistreatment, due to the subjective affectation of the person. Because of this neglect, her condition worsened to the point of death.
> 
> This case is part of a general picture of a health crisis throughout the Buenos Aires prison system that is deepening month by month without state responses tending to reverse it. At the beginning of 2022, also in a prison unit in Batán, Mar del Plata, a group of women housed in pavilion 1 presented a habeas corpus -which was accompanied by the CPM- in order to guarantee gynecological controls, attention adequate medical care and the provision of supplies, as well as medicines to the prison unit pharmacy and the appointment of more professional personnel, among other points.
> 
> The action was resolved favorably two days later by the head of the Court of Execution 1 of Mar del Plata, Dr Perdichizzi. However, the CPM –in its capacity as the Local Mechanism for the Prevention of Torture and Ill-treatment of the Province of Buenos Aires- later requested the extension of that habeas to the rest of the units that make up the Batán Complex (UP 15, 44 and 50), a request that was validated by the same magistrate when corroborating null medical attention, laziness, lack of medicines, access to specific treatments.
> 
> One of the recurring problems is that the responsibility for guaranteeing the right to comprehensive health care corresponds to the Penitentiary Health Directorate under the Ministry of Justice, but the mediation for access corresponds to the Buenos Aires Penitentiary Service. Both agencies accuse each other of different actions or omissions that contribute to the existing health disaster, but neither adopts effective measures to achieve adequate care.
> 
> On the other hand, there is no effective coordination system that links the public health system and the health units within the prisons. The Directorate of Penitentiary Health must come under the purview of the Ministry of Health so that detainees are treated under the same conditions as the rest of the citizens.
