> Kimbella Kimble, a Black trans woman just 21 years of age, died in police custody in the Harrison County Adult Detention Center approximately 24 hours after being placed in solitary confinement. A video of the incident posted to social media shows Kimbella being tased by corrections officers, while saying “I can’t breathe.” Transgender people are disproportionately likely to be incarcerated, and once there, they face much higher levels of mistreatment and violence - including a higher likelihood of being placed in solitary confinement. HRC extends its deepest condolences to Kimbella’s friends and family.


> My cousin Kimbella Kimble (RAHEEM KIMBLE) was taken to harrison county detention center and within 24 hours he would later be found deceased in solitary confinement. Upon Kimbella’s arrival, he involved in a physical altercation with another inmate. The fight was broken up by correctional officers on duty. many inmates witnessed these officers using excessive, brutal force. Kimbella , Raheem, was then placed in solitary (the hole) only to be found the next day deceased. This happened in our city to our friend. SPREAD THE WORD.
