> Not many today can say who Christine Jorgensen was. However, seventy years ago she was a huge celebrity. In studies on the North American press, it was established that Jorgensen was the person about whom the most articles were written in the newspapers and magazines of the United States during 1953. More than about the president of that country or the super stars of Hollywood.
> 
> Christine becomes famous
> 
> On February 6, 1953, the runway at the New York airport was packed with journalists. There were dozens, hundreds of them. Reporters, photographers and a few cameramen. There were also protocol cars and security guards. The Danish ambassador was waiting anxiously. What he didn't understand was why there was such a fuss. It was not the first time that a member of the royal family from his country had arrived in the United States and there had never been a reception even similar to that. But the more than three hundred journalists did not expect the princes of Denmark. His target was Christine Jorgensen, a 27-year-old woman, blonde, tall, long-legged, and elegantly dressed in an expensive fur coat.

> It may interest you: She denounced that she was kicked out of the gym for being trans

> Until two months before it was completely unknown. The issue exploded on December 1, 1952. The New York Daily News ran two front-page photos, one before and one after, and in catastrophic letters a shocking headline: “Former Soldier Turned Into Beautiful Blonde.” .
> 
> Christine Jorgensen was introduced as the first person to have undergone a sex reassignment operation.
> 
> The subject caused a unique commotion. The Sunday edition of the same newspaper, owned by Hearst, sent a reporter to Denmark to interview Christine. For the exclusive she was paid $20,000, a fortune for the time.
> 
> It may interest you: "The most desired vedette is... a former French soldier!": the crazy tour of Latin America by Coccinelle, the pioneering trans artist
> 
> Faced with journalistic harassment, Christine said that it seemed too much to her, that she only wanted to live a quiet life, that she did not understand what was happening.
> 
> But he couldn't control the effects of his appearance. She became an immediate celebrity.

> 
> To the surprise of almost everyone, she was accepted by society. People greeted her on the street, invited her to television shows, made job offers (although not very satisfactory).
> 
> Christine's childhood
> 
> He was born in 1926 in a neighborhood of the Bronx.His father was a carpenter and his mother a housewife. He was the second child of the marriage. From a very young age he realized that he did not enjoy doing what his schoolmates did. He would ask her mother why he couldn't be like her. At school he suffered bullying, although that was not yet called that. His classmates made fun of his fragility, of his not wanting to play physical games, of his having different tastes, of his thin voice, of his delicate physical appearance. He was, mainly, someone who carried an infinite sadness. Then, towards the end of the war, he enlisted in the Army. They assigned him to a desk job but he was there for more than a year and a half until the end of the contest they dismissed him. He enlisted for two reasons. To do what the others did and so that his parents, finally, they were proud. He then studied photography and dental assistant.
> 
> But he was mired in unhappiness. She felt like a woman but she had the body of a man. And, furthermore, worst of all, he had to respond to social mandates, behave like a man.
> 
> In a magazine he read about experimentation with hormonal treatments on animals. He went to libraries for months to read scientific articles that he couldn't quite understand. Every time he went to a specialized doctor, especially endocrinologists, he left the office without any response. They told him that he did not have any medical problems. The diagnosis: he was an invert; he suffered, according to those who reviewed him, a moral deviation.
> 
> Christine Jorgenson
> Someone took pity and illegally started giving her estrogen. This unofficial treatment, without being supervised by any doctor, began to transform his body little by little. He found out that in Europe, especially in Scandinavia, there were treatments and even surgical interventions. He raised money and crossed the Atlantic.
> 
> Its original destination was Sweden but before that it stopped in Denmark. There she consulted Dr. Christian Hamburger. The doctor decided, after obtaining permission from his country's Ministry of Health, to perform an experimental procedure. For a year he gave her hormonal treatment, he arranged for a psychological support team, he carried out dozens of studies and in 1951 he performed the first surgical intervention, an orchiectomy. A year later came the second, the penectomy.
> 
> At that time our protagonist took the name of Christine Jorgensen, the name she chose as a tribute to her doctor.
> 
> It is not known who leaked his story to the US press. Yeah, that Daily News cover made her a celebrity.
> 
> After her arrival in the United States, the job offers she received were not what she wanted. It was for strip shows, circuses and other places where she was going to be presented as a phenomenon. Christine rejected the proposals. She wanted to sing, act in Hollywood. "I think that what they really wanted, and at the same time they feared, was for me to walk towards a camera or to the edge of the stage, and show me naked just to satisfy her morbidity," she said.
> 
> It was known that he was not the first person to have been operated on, that this technique was almost three decades old. But it didn't matter. Christine was the attention grabber and the first to be recognized.
> 
> What is surprising is that, at that first moment, transphobia or censorship was not imposed on the strange, on what could disturb the conservative society of the fifties. That only lasted a few months. When the same Daily News reported that Christine did not have a vagina, a scandal broke out and all her hatred and contempt fell on her.
> 
> social condemnation
> 
> Society was willing to accept that it was a woman. But not that she was neither a man nor a woman according to current parameters. They no longer invited her to television, the newspaper editorials were merciless with her. It must be remembered that in those years for almost two more decades, homosexuality was considered a crime. And that gays, lesbians and transvestites were persecuted, detained and harassed by the forces of order.
> 
> The United States government, some time later, after several cumbersome procedures on her part, specially authorized Christiane to undergo a vaginoplasty.
> 
> Christine performed in nightclubs for many years.  She sang and did monologues.  She also published her autobiography Christine Jorgensen.  A Personal Autobiography which sold nearly half a million copies.  Her story was also made into a movie (Photo by Erika Stone / Photo Researchers History / Getty Images)

> But his most persistent activity and the one that had the greatest influence was the talks and conferences that he gave for years in universities and associations throughout his country. She gave visibility and dignity to trans women and made those who were rejected in their families and social groups feel accompanied. She was the first known transsexual , accepted, who made her voice heard, that she was encouraged to tell her story, without shame.
> 
> When at the end of her life, when society had become somewhat more tolerant, and she received recognition for having been a pioneer, for having had a voice and visibility when it was very difficult to do so; When she, faced with the attacks, could have secluded herself in her house, Christine continued speaking, recounting her life, and asking for understanding. When they congratulated her for it, Christine said that she had not realized her influence, that she had done it for her, to be happier, so that they would hear her story from her own mouth.
> 
> She died in 1989 from bladder cancer. She was 62 years old and was already an icon of the fight for LGBT+ rights.
