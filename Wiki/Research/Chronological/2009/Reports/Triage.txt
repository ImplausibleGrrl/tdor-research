Litte P
27 Feb 2009

Ten years of doubts and a body without respect. It took a decade for the body of the transvestite "Little P" to be transferred to the local Cemetery.


He was in the judicial morgue for a long time waiting for an answer about a death that filled his family and friends with doubts.

At the age of 29, she was found dead inside her house on February 27, 2009. The Justice determined that it was determined that Little P's death occurred by suicide.

For a long time the gaze was on his partner, Antonio Miguel Horisberger, who was finally dismissed on June 19, 2014. However, this case was shrouded in doubts by people close to Little P.

3- Rony Galante: The worst of deaths
He was popularly known as Rony or Gisela. He always stood out with his participation in the Corsos Populares Matecito.

All the joy he gave away was overshadowed with one of the most gruesome deaths we can witness.


Rony disappeared in February 2009 and his remains were found a month later in the bottom of a 'tapera' located on Boulevard Montana, a few meters from Avenida Primera Junta.

The court forensic doctor, Dr. Oscar Chiapetti, presented to the magistrate the results of the analyzes carried out on the remains of who could be Ramón Eduardo Galante, also known as “Rony” or “Gisela”, the 42-year-old transvestite.

The forensic report highlighted the existence in the left clavicle of a “callus” due to a fracture, which coincided with what happened to Rony Galante years ago.

The case was never clarified and Rony's face still flies under the banners of Aciverjus, the Civil Association for Truth and Justice.

Pequeña died by suicide.

The case of [deadname], the 29-year-old [trans woman] whose artistic name was “Pequeña P”, was found lifeless inside her home in Colombo 198 on the morning of February 27, 2009, at approximately 10:40, finally had yesterday two momentous decisions by the Justice.

The first is that his body was ordered to be transferred from the Forensic Morgue located on the North Cemetery site, to a niche; instance that was carried out with all the rigors of the law. And the second is that the judge of Guarantees and Transition N ° 1, Tobias Podestá, ruled that a comparison of DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) be made between Pequeña P; her mother, Gladys Asunción Sandoval, whose body was exhumed by the medical examiner Marcelo Benetti to extract a sample; plus another sample of conserved DNA belonging to Alejandra Sandoval (her sister), who had died last July 4, after also taking her own life.

This is a case that generated national upheaval and although Justice - after an arduous act as an extensive action - determined that the death of Pequeña P was caused by suicide by hanging; Yesterday these two steps were taken for a definitive closure of the case, when the comparative affiliation study was ordered and the body rests in a niche of the Cemetery.

The DNA collation will require approximately a little more than a month and will be carried out in the laboratories of the Forensic Genetics Service of the Superior Court of Justice of Entre Ríos, specialized in biological identification and in the establishment of biological ties of kinship between individuals, through of the study of genetic profiles and that is a member of the Argentine Society of Forensic Genetics.

In addition to the samples that will be sent to Paraná - with chain of custody as is rigorous - mirror samples remained in the jurisdiction for any contingency that is required.

About a dozen judicial officials participated in yesterday's activities, including forensic doctors Marcelo Benetti; Luis Leonardo Moyano, head of the Forensic Medical Department of the province, who was with a large part of his team; Judge Tobías Podestá, with his secretary and other personnel of his Court; two civilian witnesses working in the Cemetery and the Tuna family lawyer, Amelia Angerosa.

One of the last actions in this case was recorded on June 19, 2014, when Judge Arturo Exequiel Dumón, pronounced the dismissal of Antonio Miguel Horisberger, who had been charged with “simple homicide” in the fact investigated by Mario's death Alberto Tuna (Small P).

Advancing the judicial process, the case had passed to the Court of Instruction No. 2, in charge of then judge Dumón, who in December 2010 dictated the lack of merit to the sender, who had not been definitively detached from the cause until that 19 June 2014, when he was dismissed by Justice, who concluded that Little P had committed suicide, hanging himself.

In the same act, Judge Dumón had arranged the delivery of the body of the deceased, but the relatives never accepted to receive it and remained - until yesterday - in the deposit of the

André Luiz Ribeiro Albertini, the transvestite Andréia Albertini, died this Thursday, 9, in Mauá, in the Great São Paulo. Dr. Radamés Nardini Hospital of Clinics, where Albertini was hospitalized and died, gave no details of the case. The autopsy revealed that he had AIDS. The burial was carried out in the cemetery Santa Lídia Cemetery.

Albertini was known after leading a mess with player Ronaldo , currently at Corinthians , and two more transvestites in April 2008 in Rio. He accused the player of not paying the program and having used drugs, but he backed off and admitted having invented all the history. Ronaldo alleged that he took the group to the hotel thinking they were prostitutes and, when realizing the mistake, wanted to leave, but was blackmailed by the transvestite. They all ended up in the police station.

Andréia responded to the lawsuit, accused of attempted extortion by the Public Prosecution Service. She also went to the police station again in September 2008, after fighting with a man who accused her of robbery in Copacabana.
