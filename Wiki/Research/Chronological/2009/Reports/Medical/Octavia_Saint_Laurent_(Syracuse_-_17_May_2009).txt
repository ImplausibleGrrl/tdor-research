She was born producing more estrogen than most people assigned male at birth.[8]
> 
> Octavia said that growing up, her parents were accepting:[8] "I had wonderful parents that supported me. My sexuality was not an issue with my parents. They were accustomed to that since I was a child. People thought I looked like a little girl, and my mother said: 'This is a boy!'"[5]

> Life is like a boomerang. When you throw it, it eventually comes back to you.[14]
> If money wasn't important in the world to survive, I guess I wouldn't want anything but what I have now. But since money does, I hope that the way I look puts money in my pocket.[4]

> Gays have rights, lesbians have rights, men have rights, women have rights, even animals have rights. How many of us have to die before the community recognizes that we are not expendable?
