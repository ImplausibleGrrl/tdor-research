Tiziana Lorenzi passed away after a long agony dating back to June 27, 2009, during the procession of GenovaPride. There, on the chariot of the Transgenus Association and the Community of San Benedetto, she felt ill. From the procession she was rushed to hospital. Until the news yesterday announcing his death. For those who knew her, both on the internet and in real life, I dedicate the comments space to her memory. Anyone who wants can leave a few or many lines in his memory and in his memory. I will also leave mine in the comments.
He was a member of the Transgenus Association , which operates in Versilia and Tuscany, the region where he resided.
I express my dismay and painful surprise at the news.
