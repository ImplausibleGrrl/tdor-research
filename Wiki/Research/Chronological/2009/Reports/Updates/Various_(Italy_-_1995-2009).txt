TREVISO (January 17) - Voluntary murder: whoever killed Mateus Da Silva , a 22-year-old transsexual resident in Castelfranco Veneto, did so voluntarily, with the intention of taking his life. The killer entered, no signs of a struggle were found in the house, every object was in order, so there is a good chance it was the transsexual himself who opened the door for him. Then the friend, acquaintance or client, seeing that the Brazilian was a prostitute, turned into the killer beast: he took the boy's sarong and held it around his neck until he was suffocated. The medical examiner would have found traces on his body that would suggest an attempt at defense.

Despite this, no signs of a struggle were found in the house and every object appeared in order.

The death was traced back to the day before the body was found, although more precise indications will come from the autopsy. Meanwhile, the carabinieri listened to the last people who had seen Da Silva, while the images taken by the cameras installed at the entrance to the condominium seem unusable, at least for now.
