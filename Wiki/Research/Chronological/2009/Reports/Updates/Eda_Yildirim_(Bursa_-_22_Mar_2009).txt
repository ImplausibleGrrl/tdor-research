Bursa (Ankara?)
Turkey
stabbed


Eda Yildirim was a trans woman living in Ankara and was stabbed to death. Her decapitated body was found in a garbage container in Bursa. It turned out that Eda was killed on February [or March, as on the [[TDoR]] list?] 22.

Sadi Ã–znar, who met Eda Yildirim as the murder suspect and had a DNA sample showing that he had intercourse with her on the day of the incident, was arrested. The perpetrator, who was tried with the demand for aggravated life, was acquitted for lack of evidence.

This impunity in trans murder cases causes more murders.
