> An international court has ruled that Honduras must acknowledge its responsibility for the 2009 murder of a transgender woman and begin tracking anti-LGBTQ+ hate crimes.
> 
> The Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACHR) ruling states that the Honduran government must admit wrongdoing in the killing of Vicky Hernández, a well-known activist and sex worker. The 26-year-old was shot to death by law enforcement agents on June 28th, 2009 during a curfew imposed by the government amid a coup d’etat.
> 
> The IACHR ordered Honduras to reopen its investigation into the incident and required the government to pay reparations to Hernández’s family. Its ruling also requires Honduras collect data on anti-LGBTQ+ violence and develop strategies to prevent further incidents from occurring.
> 
> A two-page verdict issued by the IACHR Monday also requires Honduran leaders to take greater measures to support the Latin American country’s trans community. These demands include reforms to ease the process of legally correcting one’s gender in identity documents and public records and providing police forces with better training on violence against LGBTQ+ people.
> 
> The court also mandated the establishment of a special scholarship fund for trans women, named in Hernández’s honor.
> 
> Indyra Mendoza, director of the Honduran LGBTQ+ group Red Lésbica Cattrachas, said in a statement that the court case has shed light on the structural violence faced by transgender people in Honduras.
> 
> “This structural violence has been supported by fundamentalist religious narratives, the media, and the discrimination against sexually diverse people in the political, workplace, and social spheres and has translated into their exclusion and death,” said Mendoza, whose organization brought the case to court along with Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights. “Honduras must change. The Americas must change. Justice for Vicky is justice for everyone.”
> 
> According to a statement from Red Lésbica Cattrachas, a celebration of the ruling is scheduled for Thursday in four cities throughout Latin America: Tegucigalpa, Lima, Bogotá, and Buenos Aires.
> 
> While the decision is undoubtedly a historic moment for transgender people in Latin America, it remains to be seen whether Honduras will respond to the IACHR ruling.

> View Story
> The IACHR ruled in 2018 that member nations must recognize same-sex marriage, but the majority have yet to do so, including Chile and Venezuela.
> 
> Hernández’s case reportedly reached the IACHR, in part, because the country failed to address former recommendations from the court regarding violence against its queer and transgender population. Those included monitoring anti-LGBTQ+ hate crimes.
> 
> Honduras has among the world’s highest rate of anti-trans homicides, according to a global monitoring project by Transgender Europe (TGEU). At least 119 transgender people have lost their lives to violence since the 2009 coup, as Red Lésbica Cattrachas told the New York Times earlier this year, and about half of the victims were sex workers. As in the U.S., that number is likely an undercount.
> 
> And despite the ruling, LGBTQ+ advocates still face significant hurdles from a hostile government. While sexual orientation and gender identity protections are explicitly included in its anti-discrimination laws, Honduras leaders moved earlier this year to ensure same-sex marriage never becomes legal.

They ask to condemn Honduras for the murder of activist and trans woman Vicky Hernández
By: EFE
November 12, 2020, 04:52 pm
On Thursday, the victim's representatives asked the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IHL Court) for a judgment against Honduras for the murder of activist and trans woman Vicky Hernández, which occurred in 2009, to which the Honduran State denied any responsibility whatsoever in the crime. 

The two-day hearing for this case, which was held virtually, concluded this Thursday with the final oral arguments of the parties who, from now on, will have one month to present their written arguments.

Extrajudicial execution and lack of investigation
The president of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), Joel Hernández, reiterated the arguments of the accusation presented by that body to the Inter-American Court, in which he blames the State for the extrajudicial execution of Hernández, as well as a lack of diligence in the investigations that keep the case in impunity .

"For more than 10 years, the State has not designed or promoted an investigation to clarify the participation of State agents. The only hypothesis has been unsuccessful and is based on stereotypes. The State has failed to distort the clear indications of State participation in a context of violence against trans women, "said Hernández.

(Further: Argentina legalizes the self-cultivation of cannabis for medicinal use )

Vicky Hernández, a trans woman and a human rights defender in the Unidad Color Rosa organization, died of a gunshot to the head between the night of June 28, 2009 and the following day, in San Pedro Sula, within the framework of a curfew decreed as a result of the coup against President Manuel Zelaya.

"The curfews created an environment conducive to human rights violations with a disproportionate effect on trans women," said the head of the IACHR, who said that during the coup there were 15 murders of trans women, and at least 3 the same night as Hernández's.

For her part, Angelita Baeyens, activist for the human rights defender organization Cattrachas, said as representative of the victim that it is a "classic case of unlawful death at the hands of state agents", as it occurred during a touch of It remains in which the security authorities were the only ones authorized to circulate .

growing stronghold ) In his plea, Baeyens affirmed that the authorities did not investigate the crime scene, did not collect evidence, did not analyze the bullet, nor was there an autopsy and that the The investigation revolved around a "crime of passion" hypothesis, full of stereotypes and discrimination.

Baeyens asked the Inter-American Court for reparation measures for the victim's family and for it to order Honduras to process a gender identity law and legal reforms that criminalize transfemicide and allow trans people to change their name and gender with based on their self-perceived gender identity.

The state denies the charges
For its part, the representation of the State of Honduras denied all the charges attributed to it and asked the Inter-American Court to dismiss the accusation, since it considers that there is no evidence to prove its responsibility.

"The State rejects the accusation of extrajudicial execution or hate crime as the participation of State agents has not been proven , " State agent Nelson Molina said at the hearing.

According to the State representative, the participation of police agents was not demonstrated in the process, nor was there any element of "intentionality and premeditation."

Protection measures
The Inter-American Court ordered the State on Thursday measures to protect the life of Vicky Hernández's family in response to a complaint from the Cattrachas organization, which indicates that  an official from the Police Investigations Directorate (DPI) called the mother of the victim, which he considered to be a form of intimidation or harassment.

The State representation recognized the existence of the call, but argued that it was made to offer police support.

"The Inter-American Court, unanimously, has adopted provisional measures and has resolved to require the State to immediately adopt all measures to protect the right to life and personal integrity of the next of kin of Vicky Hernández and the members of the Cattrachas organization", said at the hearing the secretary of the Inter-American Court, Pablo Saavedra.



Tegucigalpa.- For the Lesbian Network Cattrachas, the life and death of Vicky Hernández exemplifies the systematic discrimination and violence experienced by trans women and LGTBI people in Honduras and even after her death.

"The case of Vicky Hernández [...] covers all the discrimination and systematic violence experienced by trans women and LGTBI people in Honduras," Nadia Mejía, a member of the Cattrachas legal team , told Criterio.hn . "All her life she was discriminated against, she did not have access to education, health, work and was attacked by private and public security agents, national police, which led to her death" and even after her murder she continued to be discriminated against. deny an autopsy on his body, he added.

At the age of 26, Vicky Hernández was assassinated during the curfew that followed the 2009 coup, between the night of June 28 and the early morning of June 29. The streets were under the control of state agents and she was seen alive for the last time when she tried not to be apprehended by members of the public forces aboard a patrol. Currently, the State of Honduras is facing charges for the alleged extrajudicial execution of Hernández before the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (I / A Court HR).

Mejía explained that as legal representatives of the victims they reaffirmed before the Inter-American Court that what happened on June 28, 2009 in the context of the coup d'état and the subsequent curfew was an extrajudicial execution based on prejudice. They also illustrated that Vicky lived in continuous violence, social and legal exclusion due to her gender identity, something that continues to affect both trans women and LGTBI people in Honduras.

In addition to seeking justice for Vicky and reparation for her relatives; Cattrachas hopes that, through this case, Honduras will advance by creating a plan of real and effective public policies through the creation of a Non-Binary Gender Identity Law, which protects and guarantees the rights of trans and non-binary people. As well as the elimination of laws that discriminate against LGTBI people.

The Inter-American Court of Human Rights convened a public hearing for November 11 and 12 Organizations That LGBTI + Consider Already historic: . The responsibility of the State of Honduras for the extrajudicial execution of Vicky Hernández, a trans woman and human rights defender, will be discussed.

Vicky was 26 years old when she was murdered, between the night of June 28 and the early morning of June 29, 2009, while a curfew was in force that she was unaware of. It was a few hours after the coup against then-president Manuel Zelaya that the de facto government of Roberto Micheletti was established. 

These two audiences are of enormous importance for the entire region and for Honduras in particular, one of the most dangerous countries in Latin America for LGBT + people.

For more than 11 years, the lesbian organization  Cattrachas has  been asking for Justice so that the murder of Vicky and also so that other hate crimes do not go unpunished: 116 trans women and 250 LGBTIQ + people have been murdered since 2009 in Honduras. 

"With so much impunity, with so many deaths, this is like collective justice," Cattrachas coordinator Indyra Mendoza told Presentes. “The names of other trans will be there. There was prejudice, discrimination, violence, hatred, but in the end we will achieve that collective justice ”.

The case came to this instance prompted by a petition from Cattrachas made on December 23, 2012. Years later, the US organization Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights joined the defense. The hearings will be virtual, at 8:30 (Central American time) and it is expected to be transmitted through the networks of the Inter-American Court. 


Marlene Wayar, called as an expert
For the hearings, the Court has summoned the Republic of Honduras, the representatives of the victims, and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to hear their arguments. And he has summoned a partner of Vicky, her family, lawyers and the Argentine transvestite activist Marlene Wayar to testify as witnesses. 

Wayar, a social psychologist, was cited to expose the role of the State as a causal nexus of systematic violence against trans people and to deploy transfemicide as a category to conceptualize crimes based on prejudice due to gender identity or expression. 

Wayar met the Honduran organization Cattrachas when she was summoned to a meeting of Lasa (Latin American Studies Association) in Boston.

Also cited as an expert, the lawyer Carlos Zelada, will explain the context of violence against LGBT people in Honduras; the idea of ​​violence due to prejudice against trans people, and standards for investigating these cases. Family members of Vicki Hernández will also testify as victims. His sister  Merelin and his mother Rosa Argelia Hernández Martínez . The criminal lawyer Edgar Fernando Pérez Archila will also render an expert opinion on how the facts of the case are part of a pattern of extrajudicial execution motivated by prejudice reasons under the standards of criminal law and the international law, and what should be the guidelines of the investigation if it is proven that it was an extrajudicial execution motivated by prejudice. 

What is reported
Vicky Hernández survived on the streets of San Pedro Sula practicing sex work. And she was a well-known activist from Unidad Color Rosa, an organization of trans women from that Honduran city. 

On the night of June 28, he went out without knowing about the curfew. That same night, Zelaya was taken from his home at gunpoint. The next morning Vicky was found dead on a street in the Ruiz neighborhood, in the northeast of San Pedro Sula. In the darkness of that night, the only people circulating in the city were the Honduran security forces.

The autopsy - carried out much later because at the time the victim was denied that possibility due to her gender identity and because she was living with HIV - revealed that Vicky was killed with a firearm, according to a  document  from the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) issued in December 2018. 

An amnesty decree dating from 2010 protects those responsible for institutional violence. The complaint seeks to eliminate him in order to identify the chain of command behind the murder of the Honduran trans activist .

 “It is alleged that the death of Vicky Hernández occurred in two relevant contexts. On the one hand, the alleged context of violence and discrimination against LGBT people in Honduras with a high incidence of acts committed by the public force and, on the other, the alleged context of the coup d'état that occurred in 2009 ”, says the text with which the Inter-American Court released the news in September 2020. 

State and bias crime
For this reason, not only is Vicky's death, violence based on prejudice, based on her gender identity and expression, but it is also argued that the Honduran State did not adequately investigate the facts of the case with due diligence and within a reasonable time. , which are in impunity. 

Because this chain  began with the crime and continued with the handling of Vicky's body, which they refused to perform an autopsy.  "Human rights organizations denounced that the forensic authorities refused to carry out the autopsy report with the excuse of assuming that the victim was living with HIV," says a document from the IACHR. 

It is alleged that “the State of Honduras is responsible for the violation of the rights established in Articles 4.1, 5.1, 8.1, 11, 13, 24 and 25.1 of the American Convention on Human Rights, in relation to the obligations established in Article 1.1 and the same instrument ”. 

In social networks the slogans are already stirring: “Justice for your family. Justice for all trans people in Honduras. Justice for all LGBTI people in Latin America ”. And they propose to join virtual activities with the hashtag #JusticiaParaVicky.

On November 11 and 12, 2020, the hearing set by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (Inter-American Court) will take place in a virtual way to issue a sentence against the State of Honduras for the crime of the trans leader Vicky Hernandez. Vicky was assassinated on June 28, 2009, the day of the coup against then-President Manuel Zelaya, which established the de facto government of Roberto Micheletti. The complaint seeks to eliminate the 2010 amnesty decree that protects the perpetrators of the coup in order to identify the chain of command that ordered the murder of the Honduran trans activist .

Vicky Hernández, the first victim of the de facto regime's extrajudicial execution during the coup, was 26 years old at the time of her murder. Vicky finished elementary school and dropped out of school to work and support her mother, sister, and niece. She was a sex worker and recognized activist for the human rights organization for trans women Unidad Color Rosa of San Pedro Sula, Honduras.

The night of the crime
Vicky took to the streets on the night of June 28 to engage in sex work without knowing about the curfew imposed by the de facto government. That night, Zelaya was taken from his home at gunpoint and sent on a plane to Costa Rica.

On the morning of the 29th, Vicky was found dead on a street in the Ruiz neighborhood, in the northeast of San Pedro Sula. Agents from the National Directorate of Criminal Investigation carried out the removal of the body at 7:30 in the morning. The night before, there were only state security forces in the streets of Sampedra. This raised suspicions among sexual diversity organizations and human rights defenders that those responsible for the murder have ties to the Honduran state.

The corpse of the trans activist had "an irregular wound in her left eye" and another similar one "in the left frontal region." The coroner concluded that Vicky was killed by a firearm, ”according to a document from the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) issued in December 2018.


Hearing at the Inter-American Court of Human Rights
The chain of impunity began with the crime and continued with the handling of Vicky's body, which was transferred to the Forensic Medicine facilities in the north of San Pedro Sula, where the authorities refused to perform an autopsy. "Human rights organizations denounced that the forensic authorities refused to carry out the autopsy report with the excuse of assuming that the victim was living with HIV," the IACHR document states.

"They did not want to undertake any investigation because they considered that the victim was a 'different' person and without rights, which constitutes discrimination based on their sexual preferences," adds a petition filed on December 23, 2012 by the Cattrachas organization and the United States' Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights organization later joined the defense.

Later, the authorities argued that they had carried out the autopsy, but there are no official records that it was performed.

The wake of the transsexual leader Vicky Hernández took place at the headquarters of the Unidad Color Rosa collective, Colectivo TTT de San Pedro Sula. They buried her in La Puerta, a cemetery for the general population located in the south of the city.

From impunity to hope
Vicky Hernández has ceased to be another number in the long list of violent deaths of LGBTIQ + people in Honduras to become a sign of hope for the traditionally despised groups in the country.

Since the activist's murder in 2009 to date, at least 366 LGBT people have been violently killed, including 117 transgender women like Vicky. But the Honduran Penal Code still does not include the word "transfemicide" on its pages to typify the murder of transsexual women and men. Almost all the cases, including Vicky's, remain unpunished.

“A murderer in Honduras has a 96% chance that the system will not catch him. It is big business to be a hit man in Honduras; 96% possibility and the community, 98% ”, he adds, delving into the causes of the high numbers of impunity in Honduras. This is due to the deficient investigation in Honduras ”, explains to Presentes the lawyer and university professor Ramón Enrique Barrios


The activist Indyra Mendoza, from the Cattrachas network
According to Barrios, the investigative bodies themselves consider that members of the LGBTI community are killed because they deserve it. There are even fundamental religious prejudices, as society believes that they deserve it because "they do not follow the traditional dictates of God."

The lesbian organization Cattrachas has been working in its more than 11 years of struggle so that Vicky's case does not go unpunished. This is just the beginning of an effort to make those responsible for the crimes against the 116 other trans women and 250 LGBTIQ + people killed since 2009 also pay.

"With so much impunity, with so many deaths, this is like collective justice," says Cattrachas coordinator, Indyra Mendoza. “The names of other trans will be there. There was prejudice, discrimination, violence, hatred, but in the end we will achieve that collective justice ”.

"It was an extrajudicial execution"
The team led by Cattrachas and Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights has called for the repeal of the 2010 amnesty decree that has allowed all crimes committed during the 2009 coup to go unpunished. In this way, justice may fall on the human rights violators shielded behind the coup. "It was an extrajudicial execution, but there was a chain of command around them," says Indyra Mendoza.

The other results of the group of litigants led by Indyra Mendoza are the economic and psychological objections that the Honduran State must grant to the family of the transsexual activist murdered on the day of the coup that deposed Manuel Zelaya to impose the de facto government of Roberto Micheletti.

"With the establishment of the curfew, the de facto authorities justified the militarization of the Honduran territory and the presence of the military and police in the streets," says Cattrachas.

"Show that our bodies are worth"
In addition, the organization based in Tegucigalpa registers 31 murders of LGBTI people during the eight months that Micheletti's government lasted, of which 15 were trans women and 16 were gay. That number exceeds the total documented between 2003 and 2008. Cattrachas identifies a pattern of murders against trans women, which supports the theory that most of them were extrajudicial executions.

Vicky's case is surrounded by mysteries and tainted by impunity. By refusing to do an autopsy because authorities said they were living with HIV, "he suffered discrimination even after his murder," says Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Director of International Litigation and Advocacy Angelita Baeyens.

“It is very significant that a case of lethal violence against a trans woman comes to the Inter-American Court for the first time because it opens the door to make the situation of this population visible and expose all the abuses committed in that case. It's not just Vicky's tragic story. It is that of hundreds of trans women in Honduras and the region who are victims of constant discrimination and violence on the part of the authorities and many other sectors of the population, ”adds Baeyens.

“It's like showing that our bodies are also worth, our lives are worth, our struggles are worth. That is important to me, ”says Indyra Mendoza.

The IACHR held Honduras responsible in May 2019 for the death of Vicky Hernández.

According to the Commission, “taking into account such contexts, the fact that the streets were under total control of the public force, as well as the lack of judicial clarification of what happened, there are enough elements to conclude the direct responsibility of the State for the death by Vicky Hernández ”.

For the agency, the murder of Hernández "constituted an assumption of violence due to prejudice against his gender identity and expression."

It was a transfemicide
The team from the Robert F. Kennedy organizations of Human Rights and Cattrachas hopes that the legal term “transfemicide” will be recognized in Vicky's assassination, but the road has been strewn with obstacles.

A first step to reach the goal was to establish a pattern in the murders of LGBTI people and especially trans women during the coup in Honduras as a way to categorize these crimes as extrajudicial executions.

“These transfemicides were carried out late at night, during illegal curfews, when the streets were in the absolute custody of the military and police public forces. Furthermore, most of the victims were engaged in sex work and were executed with a shot to the head, ”says Cattrachas.

According to the pattern identified in the 15 murders of trans women committed during the de facto regime of Roberto Micheletti, Cattrachas created the following definition of the word 'transfemicide': “Violent death of trans women, motivated by prejudice, contempt and discrimination gender and the assumed identity of the victims, being the materialization of a systematic violence due to social and state exclusion ”.

In spite of everything, the merits report of the Inter-American Commission recognizes that Vicky's extrajudicial execution was a transfemicide. This is the first time that the term "transfemicide" has been used within the inter-American system.

Vicky's death is the first transfemicidal extrajudicial execution recognized by the Inter-American System. For the Commission, the case can be classified as a murder for prejudice based on gender identity and there are strong indications that the Honduran State is directly involved in the crime.

However, to this day the State continues to deny the human rights violations that occurred during the coup d'état and the direct involvement of public order agents in Vicky's murder.
