> My biography
> 
> Must-see passage?
> There is a moment when, even if it seems a little exhibitionism and unboxing, we can not help
> but briefly summarize to the world why we have come to this ...
> 
>  Until this day of 2005, I had deferred the exercise ....
> So let's sum up ... Once upon a time ....
> 
>  1950: My mother gives birth in June to a "little boy" (obviously) ...: me.
> In 1948, she had lost after 7 1/2 months pregnant my eldest, Joseph ... that "your father was laid to rest in his little wooden box, crying all the tears in her body" ...
> How times have I not heard that!
> So whether we like it or not, I was there to replace the other ...
> Since it was a boy, my father would not have admitted anything else ... It was less clear to my mother.
> Once out of her postpartum depression, she raised me like a little girl until I was two ...
> 
> 
> I was one year old, above ... but at two years old, below, snap !! the hair is cut!
> 
>  From then on I MUST be a boy, whatever my moods ... And besides that boy must be perfect ...
> 
>  My parents had no age to have others, I'm high single child object of attention, of all prohibited, all framing and warnings ...
> Whatever that I am hypersensitive and more attracted to the sweetness of girls 'games than to the violence of boys' games, I MUST be a boy ... play soccer because my dad was a footballer and not cry, not complain, learn to fight against "the attackers" of the playgrounds instead of taking refuge crying in the skirts of the mistress ...
> Few provisions for this kind of exercise but whatever ...
> And of course a ban on playing with it little girls ... "A boy doesn't play girl's games!"
> My mother "who sacrificed her career to raise me" taught me to read, write, count ...
> At three years old I read fluently. I entered kindergarten (boys, of course, to time) to "socialize" me by already knowing everything that we learned there ... except that I was not able to resist the pressure of the little males and that my side "little learned angel" made me hate already little assholes future machos ...
> 
>  I skipped classes in elementary school ... no CP ... no CE2 ... always first and award of excellence without possible discussion ...
> To find myself at 9 years old in the certificate class studies with kids of 13 years past who wore their last panties on these benches ...
> I almost got raped there! ... It came to the surface during a discussion in 2005 with Viviane… like what it was buried very deep in my unconscious…
> G., B. and T., three "grown-ups" of the same class or the other class of the certificate stuck me in the WC and lowered my panties ...
> I still have the smell of cresyl in my nostrils ...
G. > wanted me to suck it, B. stick the brush in my ass and T. was on the lookout ...
> I was saved by the end of recess bell and I ran to take refuge crying in the blouse of Mr. Lebon, my teacher, without saying anything ... I never said anything, even to my mother ...
> 
> In the photo below, I am in the third row from the bottom, second from the right ... The teacher is Monsieur Lebon ... And Jacques, whom I will find in 2008 , is also in this photo (second row, fourth from the left)
> 
> 
> So it came out only 46 years later! ...
>  High school years ... 10 years in sixth grade, 17 years old on the day of the bac ...
> At 12 years old I had my IQ measured at 165 ... I learned later that it meant gifted ...
> No difficulty to reach the end ...
> At 15-16 years old I still understood that my body was well worth that of others and that in sport I was largely as good ... My complex of protruding ribs disappeared at the same time that I put a pile to them in the 80m, in the high jump or in the shot put ...
> But during all this time, the unstoppable need to dress myself in secret with my mother's things, taking good care of control everything, not to disturb anything, so that she does not notice anything ...
> Why? I had no idea...
> 
>  And I had never had (any more than I had afterwards) the least homosexual temptation ...
> 
>  16 years old ... I have to go to the final year ... My father wants me to do Arts and Crafts, like him, with a prep in Armentières ... I don't want to ...
> I do it on purpose to make me put pathetic in maths in first so as not to be admitted in math-élem and from there to exclude the eventuality prepa and Gadzarts ...
> My father always resented me. I pass the science-ex bac, easy, with honors in 67 ...
> 
>  In 68, first emotions ... I fall in love with Catherine ... What a funny idea, knowing that I have no real sexual drive and that I really would not know what to do with it ... But hey ... Between Catherine and the stadium, I waste my year of PC1 and I retype in 68-69… while continuing to travel on occasion with the maternal clothes… (the shoes are really too short now…) minimum of effort, maximum sport ...
> I won academy and regional championship titles in athletics ... fourth best French performance in the discus throw in juniors ... for a future trans!
> 
>  69-70… I emigrated to Besançon, with a view to integrating a school of chemical engineers which took people without having gone through prep…
> I didn't give a shit about being an engineer or not. ..
> 
>  I find my future wife there, very tender and in love, needing to feel protected, who makes me fall, temporarily, in the camp of males or so-called such ... It was she who had my flower ... I was barely 20 years old ...
> We are having a wonderful holiday in Brittany ...
> 
>  I am not 21 years old ...
> I have to ask for parental permission to marry her ...
> She is of course refused .. They had other views for me!
> To return to the North, to return as an engineer to the factory where my father worked, and possibly to push myself into the arms of the daughter of one of his colleagues ...
> For the first time, I say NO.
> I'm waiting to be 21 years and 2 months ... it's been 37 years of marriage in this year 2008 when I reread these lines ...
> 
>  And always these episodes of travelottage by stealing moments from existence ...
> Difficult periods from 71 to 75 .. I can not find my balance and she does not allow me to find it ... Who am I ?
> Why do I still need to be a woman so much to find "satisfaction"?
> 73: I get my engineering degree and get reformed.
> I will not go in cooperation to Madagascar ....
> 
>  I play my role as best I can until I go crazy in 75 and go back to see if Catherine's grass is greener ...
> A disaster!
> I no longer know where I am ...
> I am harmful to others and also to myself ...
> 
>  I wisely take the way home (which we bought) ... I find work at 500km which makes me come back every week ... and in October, my wife tells me that a baby will be born in June 76 ! ...
> Wonderful feeling, never regretted to this day ... A real happiness! ...
> 
>  Happiness which forces me, however, to play the role of father and husband for a while ... and therefore to put aside my trans impulses, which have never left me and which I thought - what a mistake - see s 'attenuate, or even disappear over time ...
> 
>  In 1976, I found a job near Besançon ... in teaching ... Simple teacher until 79, then full-time teacher and assistant manager until 93 ...
> At this date I understand from my costs that we must not overshadow those who hold the handle ...
> Doing the job of two for me alone was incomprehensible for mediocre ...
> I become a simple teacher ... I am there always, teaching only in post-bac classes, at the top of the ladder, not too far from retirement, and much happier like that!
> I only finished digesting this episode at the end of 2004 ... (see further)
> 
>  And during all these years, a sexual relationship assumed from time to time, experienced - for me - as a punishment, a chore, despite all the sincere love I have for my wife ...
> 
>  My wife's serious illness for several years ... I feel responsible for it but I have no way of remedying it ... She ends up by doing so where many others have passed away .. .
> Miracle? (I do not believe it) or simply will to live?
> I still feel so disgusting to still have, and without any regression, these impulses of cross-dressing and this feeling that I am not in my body ...
> 
>  1994: my daughter obtains her bac C ... and goes to study in Canada ...
> 1995: my father dies ... a release for me ...
> I could not have told her that I was not the boy he wanted to have made and trained.
> 1998: my daughter finishes her studies and obtains her diploma ...
> The graduation ceremony (in Canada, it is something grandiose) gives me an immense feeling of relief ... I am released from my mission .. .
> End of 1998: an inverted papilloma starts in my sinuses ... I spend three times on the pool .. failed twice, only the third frees me ...
> 
>  I understand then that what's stuck inside MUST come out or I'll leave my skin there with cancer crap or something like that ...
> 
>  I tell a shrink everything ... a nullity: "If your wife does not suit you, change!" How can you say bullshit like this even if since 1994 we haven't had sex?
> The problem was not there, he did not want to hear it.
> End of 1999: death of my mother ... another release ...
> 
>  I keep trying to figure out how to get it all out without spraying everything around me ...
> Because, even though it may seem silly, I LOVE my wife! ... with a sincere and protective love that is in no way based on sex ...
> 
>  In June 2001, I met Jeanne, whom I had already met on the Minitel ...
> The Minitel era (the 90s) and the Internet era (from 98) made me understand that my problem was that many others, who experienced it or assumed it in very different ways ...
> I have met many travs (Viviane in 93) but I did not feel much in common with what they expressed.
> Discussions with Jeanne (operated in 2003 in Ghent) make me understand much better what is going on in me ...
> I confess the whole package to my wife ... who suspected it all the same a little, but didn't couldn't quite clearly identify the problem ...
> 
>  In 2003, I told my doctor and friend for 34 years now (when I arrived in Besançon) and I started psychotherapy / psychoanalysis ...
> My psychologist is an amazing guy who freed me from a lot of problems.
> In particular, at the beginning of 2005, he brought me out of a depressive phase caused by my professional context.
> This time I did a good job of cleaning up the essentials and the accessories.
> In 2004 I got in touch with a competent team with a view to my reassignment ... My shrink gave his written consent for the planned operation.
> On January 18, 2005, my doctor pierced the lobes of both ears. From this date, I will systematically have two pearls (my birthday present from June 2004) or two ear rings. Sign can be discreet, but important of a feminization in progress ...
> In 2005 also I obtain my ALD in August, I start laser hair removal and I start my hormonal treatment at the beginning of October.
> I also started for good, in August, the "real life test" ... (Viviane helped me a lot on this)
> From there, Louise is almost always in Louise ...
> And I also started to express myself and participate in a few rare forums (in particular mutatis mutandis which, at that time, was a reference) to exchange with friends and also, if I can,
> 
>  April 24, 2006: a great day! The competent team has scheduled my operation: it will be in 2008!
> 
>  I also started, in June, a "rehabilitation" of the voice ... We will see if there will be results ...
> I also made contact for the end of October with the specialist of the team competent in this area. A small surgical intervention on the vocal cords does not seem essential to him in addition to the work of rehabilitation.
> 
>  In September, I went to see my notary to prepare the necessary elements for an act of notoriety allowing me to use Louise as the usual first name ... It now often becomes difficult not to be similar to what people say. my identity papers ...
> My colleagues Dominique and Patrick, who have known Louise en Louise for quite some time, signed as witnesses. At the end of October, the document was in my hands.
> I also contacted a lawyer from Dijon to have my first names changed through the courts.
> 
>  Louise, a transsexual, has definitely taken precedence over Jean-Louis, a badly assumed "man", forced to play a role that was not really his ...
> 
>  My wife and I have decided to continue our journey together ...
> The most difficult for her is to "find her place" in a new relationship between us ...
> It is not at all (at all) easy!
> The image that she has of herself and the one that she believes others send back to her are important obstacles to overcome ...
> My therapist is trying to help her and I'm sure he will succeed ...
> 
>  2007: Year which saw the end of my "coming-out" ... At the end of January, it's over, including on a professional level ...
> Year which saw on April 17th Jean-Louis legally become Louise by judgment of the TGI ...
> There was no blockage in this area.
> Year of completion of my "two years of protocol" ... in October ...
> ... and also of the beginning at the end of February of electric facial hair removal (ouch!) ...
> And what else? ... I do not dare believe in the reassignment before the end of the year ... But what would I be relieved if it was the case !!
> 
>  On May 9, I learned that I could be operated on in Montreal on October 30 by Doctor Yvon Ménard . There at least I have a firm date, which the Ghent team could not or wanted to tell me despite several requests from me ...
> This is why I will cross the Atlantic. It will cost me more, but success is certain.
> Of course I had to get a passport with my old names to be sure I could buy my plane ticket early enough. But now I have it. A priori nothing will be able to prevent me from succeeding!
> 
>  There are still a few years of hope ahead of me which, as everyone knows, brings life to life! Time will tell...
> 
> And on Tuesday October 30 , 2007 , it SHOULD have been Louise's rebirth under the expert scalpel of Doctor Yvon Ménard in Montreal ...
> 
> Five more months of waiting! Thank you Air France ....
> 
> December 30, 2007 ..... Take stock at the end of the year ...
> Louise is now Louise, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week ... both in professional life and anywhere else. .. and without the slightest problem ...
> Louise has papers corresponding to her identity: driving license, electoral card, identity card, passport ...
> There is just the Vitale card, in progress ... Administratively Louise is therefore definitely Louise.
> Louise is accepted by everyone, with the notable exception of a colleague of her spouse, who is particularly narrow-minded, and an equally obtuse brother-in-law ... What they have in common: both professors in university of letters ... To believe that intellectualism ends up obscuring common sense and humanity ... To go through profit and loss!
> On the other hand, the friendship of some (and especially some) work colleagues warms her heart (thank you Pascale!)
> Louise has not yet operated ... because of irresponsible strikers sawing without even realizing it. branch they are sitting on. However, a delay of 5 months is not fatal ... just very hard to bear!
> In March, Louise will fly to Montreal on Air Canada from Zürich! Franco-French risks: over!
> Louise has breasts that are still too small ... which means that Dr Yvon Ménard will take care of them at the same time as the rest on April 1, 2008 ...
> Louise has kept her old friends and especially found a friend with an A ... Friend of the Heart , exceptional in every way ... For that alone, 2007 was a good year for Louise, despite the setbacks of October 26 ...
> In 2008, in addition to one month of April loaded with the scheduled birth of a second little girl (what happiness!) and the long-awaited operation, the continuation of the change of civil status will occupy her ...
> Going from "M" to "F" and from "1" to "2" legally while remaining married is possible. There is at least one precedent ...
> Louise is generally calm at the start of 2008 ...
> 
> June 2008 ..... The 7th ... I am 58 years old ... my first little girl is three years old .. the second a little over two months .... Now most of my way is accomplished since April 1 ...
> I will still have to complete my change of civil status ... I will undertake this in September ...
> We will have crossed our 37 years of marriage on August 7 ...
> 
> December 27, 2008: A year later, when I reread what I wrote at the end of 2007 ...
> It's so recent and already so far away ....
> Louise feels good about herself, having had no physical problem for almost 9 months ...
> Louise and her wife are still together and have no intention of changing this ...
> And a confirmation: Lil is indeed my true Friend of the Heart ... always so amazing and exceptional ...
> Louise also found his old friends! 40 years later ...
> A question remains unanswered ... my change of marital status... the public prosecutor having expressed his opposition to my request, because it "disturbs" the fact that two people of the same "sex" remain married (our marriage having nevertheless been celebrated while we were not of the same sex, the birth of our daughter having confirmed the biological reality of this question ..)
> In short ... we are not at the end!
> Project for 2009: see Doc Ménard again , who, on April 20, will take care of doing some work on my face ... just to feminize the whole a little better ... To be continued!
> 
> September 17, 2009: A "news item" concerning my friend Jeanne pains me a lot ...
> 
> October 4, 2010: Over a year without updating my biography ...
> Life goes by quietly, without much to mention ...
> So why today ??? Just because it marks the day of my retirement from teaching, after ... a number ... of years in an environment where I will undoubtedly miss some students, but certainly not the "system" ...
> A page turns! Such is life ?
> NB: I only publish on this site items that are publishable ... The rest is strictly private part of my life ...
