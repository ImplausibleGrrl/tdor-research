Lady Butterfly, 35, a dancer and animator at the Axé Moi leisure complex, was killed in the early hours of Monday, 18, in Porto Seguro, in the south of Bahia. The police are investigating the involvement of the victim's partner in the crime, as he reportedly escaped with Butterfly's car and other belongings.

The transvestite, whose name is Daniel José Oliveira Júnior, was murdered in her apartment on Avenida Coqueiral, in the Golden Dolphin condominium. She was hit with a knife in the chest.

Witnesses informed the police that the dancer came to ask for help, but she died en route to Hospital Luís Eduardo Magalhães.

Before fleeing the scene, the suspect dropped his ID. According to reports from residents of the condominium, the man entered the apartment accompanied by the victim. The information is from the Radar64 website.

The direction of Axé Moi regretted the crime through her Facebook profile: "She is gone, but her joy and brightness will be eternal in our lives. Follow with the angels!".
The burial will take place this Tuesday, at the Pousada Eterna Cemetery, in the city center.b
