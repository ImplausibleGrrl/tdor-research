> He murdered at least four people, likely 10, and possibly more. His victims, which included an unidentified toddler and her mother, were left discarded like trash along a short stretch of beach highway. Over the last decade, his specter became a pop culture boogeyman.
> 
> And now, authorities may have finally caught LISK: the Long Island serial killer.
> 
> On Friday morning, police on Long Island swarmed tiny Massapequa Park, a small village located about 20 minutes from Jones Beach Island, the long, narrow strip of land where all of LISK’s assumed victims were recovered between 2010 and 2011. There, they took 59-year-old Rex Heuermann, an architect and building consultant, into custody.
> 
> According to the New York Post, authorities first identified Heuermann as a potential person of interest over a year ago due to a DNA match. Evidence has connected him with the first group of LISK’s confirmed victims, known as “the Gilgo four.” These were the first four victims, who were all discovered in December 2010 around the Gilgo Beach stretch of the island.
> 
> Heuermann was subsequently charged with the murders of three of the original four recovered victims — Melissa Barthelemy, Amber Lynn Costello, and Megan Waterman. He was arraigned in court Friday, where he entered a plea of not guilty. Evidence linking him to the crimes according to court documents include phone records, internet searches, and DNA.
> 
> The news of Heuermann’s arrest sent social media into a frenzy, as the true crime community celebrated a huge win for an investigation many people doubted would ever be closed. That’s because the LISK case, also referred to as the Gilgo Beach murders or the Long Island Ripper case, is one of the most complicated, confusing, and frustrating serial killer cases in recent memory.
> 
> The reasons for this are complex, but they’re also very familiar. Like many serial killers, LISK targeted sex workers, likely due to the myriad factors that can lead to sex workers being marginalized and missing, often going unreported and unidentified. Authorities sometimes fail to take the disappearances of sex workers seriously, which can hinder investigations. In this case, a jaw-dropping level of alleged corruption and misconduct from the former Suffolk County Police chief further jeopardized the entire investigation. Then we have the killer himself, whose MO may have changed over time, leading to questions about how many murders he committed or whether he was working with a partner.
> 
> As developments unfold, there are plenty of new and unresolved questions about this case. The biggest is one that has haunted the case since its inception: Are all LISK’s victims the work of one serial killer, or are there multiple perpetrators stalking the wilds of Long Island?
> 
> Here’s what to know about the murders that became an eerie shadow for a generation of New Yorkers, and what we know so far about the man who may have committed them.
> 
> The LISK case was long and frustrating — and very scary
> The LISK case burst into the public’s awareness because of Shannan Gilbert, a 23-year-old aspiring singer who vanished on May 1, 2010. Prior to her death, Gilbert made a 23-minute 911 call in which she wandered, confused and disoriented, around the Oak Beach neighborhood where she’d had an earlier escort appointment, frantically begging for help and claiming to be in danger. Gilbert’s body was eventually discovered in December 2011, in the marshes near Oak Beach. Thirteen years later, the nature of Gilbert’s death remains a subject of controversy. Her unsolved case has long been considered by authorities to be unrelated to LISK, but it’s because of her that the deaths of LISK’s actual victims — most of whom were marginalized — were ever investigated at all.
> 
> In December 2010, the investigation into Gilbert’s death uncovered four bodies, subsequently dubbed “the Gilgo four.” All were discovered over a two-day period, all discarded near each other along desolate Ocean Parkway, a two-lane road that spans the length of Jones Beach Island, a long strip of land that forms part of Long Island’s South Shore.
> 
> First was the body of Melissa Barthelemy, discovered on December 11, 2010. Barthelemy, a 24-year-old cosmetologist, had first gone missing in July 2009. The subsequent investigation into Barthelemy’s death quickly located three more bodies. The second located victim was Amber Lynn Costello, 27, who had gone missing in September 2010. Next police located 25-year-old Maureen Brainard-Barnes, a single mom who’d gone missing in 2007. Finally, Megan Waterman, 22, a single mom who had gone missing in June 2010. All four of the victims were sex workers of similar age, height, and appearance; all four of their bodies were found whole, three wrapped in burlap.
> 
> Over the next five months, the partial remains of six other victims, all disposed of along Ocean Parkway, were discovered. Because these bodies were dismembered and their remains scattered in various locations, there is some debate about whether they are related to the Gilgo four.
> 
> In July 2003, the fifth victim to be discovered, thought to be connected to the others, 20-year-old Jessica Taylor, also went missing from New York City; her partial remains were found in Manorville, Long Island, later that same month. But it wasn’t until March 2011 that authorities recovered her skull along the Gilgo Beach highway.
> 
> The sixth victim to be discovered, in April 2011, was an Asian trans woman in her late teens or early 20s. Early media reports and true crime blogs frequently misgendered her, though more recently, she has been referred to as “Gilgo Beach Doe” or “Ocean Parkway Doe.” She is believed to have been killed up to five years earlier by a blow to the head. Very little is known about this victim; like most of the other LISK victims, she is believed to have been a sex worker.
>

> A modified police reconstruction sketch, showing what Gilgo Beach Doe might have looked like. Suffolk County Police/Imgur
> In April, the remains of an unidentified toddler, the seventh victim, were found. Subsequently, the partial remains of an eighth victim, a Black woman known as “Peaches” because of a peach tattoo she had, were found in Cedar Beach off Ocean Parkway. Her initial set of remains had previously been located in Hempstead Lake State Park in 1997. This state park is about 45 minutes away from where more of her remains were ultimately located in April 2011. “Peaches” was confirmed through DNA matching to be the mother of the unidentified toddler. Both mother and daughter are believed to be LISK victims. Authorities have recently traced Peaches’ possible roots to Alabama but have not yet made an identification.
> 
> The ninth victim, 24-year-old Valerie Mack, went missing in October 2000. In November 2000, her torso was found in Manorville, 40 minutes away from Gilgo Beach. Known for years as “Jane Doe no. 6,” Mack, who also went by Melissa Taylor, was eventually identified in 2020 via forensic genealogy. She had never been reported missing.
> 
> The partial remains of the 10th LISK victim, known as “Fire Island Jane Doe,” were first discovered in 1996 on Fire Island. Her skull was discovered in April 2011, just south of Gilgo in Tobay Beach. She is believed to be LISK’s earliest known victim.
> 
> 
> A reconstruction of Fire Island Jane Doe. Suffolk County Police/Uncovered
> It’s easy to see just from this list how confusing and troubling these murders were. The victims were found in a relatively short time but had been murdered over a range of more than a decade. The thought that a serial killer had been operating, undetected, for all of that time rattled the community of Long Island as well as true crime watchers around the globe.
> 
> As pressure grew to catch the killer, Suffolk County Police Chief James Burke, appointed in 2012, came under fire for refusing to work with the FBI. But Burke had bigger problems: He was then attempting to cover up his brutal beating of a suspect who stole a bag of sex toys from his car. His efforts to obstruct the FBI’s investigation into the beating ultimately wound up implicating Burke, the county prosecutor, the deputy prosecutor, and multiple members of the Suffolk police force.
> 
> The case heats up — and becomes a true crime linchpin
> All of this directly impacted the LISK case, which languished for years as a result of Burke’s hostility toward the FBI and his ongoing legal problems. But during this time, amid the burgeoning true crime boom of the 2010s, LISK was capturing the attention of the nation. A 2016 Netflix documentary series, The Killing Season, drew widespread attention to the case, as did numerous podcasts and a book, The Lost Girls, which was subsequently adapted in 2020 into a fictionalized Netflix drama.
> 
> The victims’ families weren’t always happy with this increased publicity; in April 2023, a lawyer for two of the victims’ families objected to a LISK panel at a local true crime festival.
> 
> In 2018, Burke was replaced by, ironically, a longtime FBI agent. Geraldine Hart was the first female police chief in Suffolk County’s history. She immediately resumed full-scale investigation into the LISK case, and in 2020 released an eye-catching piece of new evidence: a belt found near one of the crime scenes, believed to belong to the perpetrator. Inscribed upon the belt was what appeared to be an insignia:
> 
> 
> Belt believed to belong to LISK. Suffolk County Police/Gilgo News
> This insignia proved as mysterious as everything else about the case; web sleuths debated what the symbols meant. Were they letters? Symbols? Nothing? As recently as a month ago, one Redditor declared the belt was “probably a misdirection” and that attempts to track down a killer with the initials “HM” were probably futile. They may have been partly right; after Friday’s arrest, many have pointed out that “HM” might stand for “Heuermann.”
> 
> Hart’s replacement, police commissioner Rodney Harrison, also tackled the case with zeal. In a 2022 press conference, he described law enforcement’s “relentless pursuit to identify the individuals and bring them to justice.”
> 
> What we know about the suspect so far
> Rex Heuermann in a gray suit poses for a photo in front of a brick Manhattan building.
> Rex Heuermann. RH Architecture
> Married with two adult children, Heuermann is a lifelong Long Island resident whose specialty as an architect seems to be dealing with the New York City building code. In a 2022 YouTube interview, he spoke about knowing the details of city codes and compared himself to a “hammer.” His architecture firm, R.H. Architecture, has since removed its staff listing, which also included a listing for one of Heuermann’s relatives. According to the New York Times, Heuermann lived in his dilapidated family home and his neighbors largely avoided him. One neighbor described him to the New York Post as “a big talker,” adding that it “makes sense that he’s a serial killer.”
> 
> Heuermann’s arrest comes less than a day after authorities discovered a new set of skeletal remains in the Suffolk County town of Islip (about 20 minutes from Jones Beach Island, where most of the LISK victims’ remains were found), but so far no connection is known.
> 
> On July 14, police went to Heuermann’s Massapequa Park neighborhood, where they searched his residence. Authorities were spotted removing a large cooler from Heuermann’s home on Friday, though the significance of this discovery has not been made clear.
> 
> According to his lawyer, Michael Brown, Heuermann was “in tears” after his arraignment on Friday, insisting that he “did not do this.” But while the case against Heuermann seems to be circumstantial, it’s compelling. For starters, according to court documents, Heuermann’s wife was out of town every time each of the three victims Heuermann is charged with killing went missing. Heuermann also had a long history of conducting internet searches for extreme sexual kinks, as well as an interest in serial killers and specifically LISK.
> 
> And then there’s the DNA: Authorities matched DNA found on the burlap material used to wrap Waterman’s body to a discarded pizza crust from Heuermann obtained by police in January 2023.
> 
> Still, this case is by no means open and shut. There will be more prosecutions to follow, and more questions to answer. One of the big ones: Are there more victims? Among the list of other potential LISK victims are Tina Foglia, whose dismembered remains were found in Gilgo Beach in 1986; Judith Ramona Veloz, who went missing from New York City in 1993; and Natasha Jugo, whose car was found abandoned in Gilgo Beach in 2013.
> 
> After Heuermann’s arrest, victims’ families expressed their thanks to police and their relief that a killer might finally have been caught. “The suspect deserves to rot in prison for the rest of his life,” Gilbert’s sister Sherre Gilbert told NBC News. “He destroyed many lives so while it won’t bring our loved ones back, it does help that one less monster is off the streets and he can’t ever hurt anyone else!”
> 
> Among the many grateful bystanders was New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, who issued her own statement about the arrest.
> 
> “I know there is a community out there that, as the facts unfold, will be sleeping a lot easier tonight,” Hochul said.
>
> Who is the suspected trans female LISK victim known as "Asian Male" and "Gilgo Beach Doe"?
> A recent post here asking which case stuck in people's minds prompted me to make this late TDOV post. Several unidentified suspected Long Island Serial Killer victims came up, and it became apparent that many people are not aware that the Doe usually referred to as "Asian Male" was found wearing women's clothing and most likely lived as a woman. For example, this information is not available on her NamUs page.
> 
> The sex trade is a major source of employment for trans women living on the margins. If both are the case for this victim, then it would be consistent with the victim pattern for LISK, who targeted female sex workers. I will refer to the victim hereafter as "Gilgo Beach Doe", after her Unidentified Wiki entry name. [EDIT: this victim has also been called "Ocean Parkway Doe", link below.] [Further edit: I have been asked to nuance my language regarding the relationship between trans women and sex work. My original wording, "the sex trade is one of the only stable sources of employment for trans women", reflected my lived experience.] The case is pinned in the case map of the Trans Doe Task Force and the existing facial reconstruction is featured prominently in some of their articles.
> 
> Not much is known about Gilgo Beach Doe. At the time of discovery on April 4th 2011, her remains were completely skeletonized, placing her time of death in the years 2001-2006, according to her Doe Network page. Her suspected cause of death is homicide by a blow to the head.
> 
> She was young, with an estimated age of 17-23 years old, and had a medium stature of 5"6 (167 cm). She may have had a muskuloskeletal disorder that affected her gait. She suffered from poor dental health, and there is no mention of a dental work history for her. She was missing top and bottom molars, and most importantly for anyone who might recall her, she was missing a front tooth at the time of her death. Her hair colour and length, as well as her eye colour and body type, are unknown.
> 
> I have not found information about which analyses, if any, have determined that she had Asian heritage. If this was estimated through her skull and dental characteristics only, it is possible that this information is incorrect, or that she is of mixed ancestry. I have also not found information about whether her chromosomal sex has been conclusively determined, or whether her skeleton was sexed using tooth enamel density (highly reliable) or visual analysis (higher chance of an error that can persist for years without being re-examined, as in the case of Kerry Graham).
> 
> There is no indication that isotope analysis was done to determine where Gilgo Beach Doe grew up. It seems particularly important to determine whether she grew up in the United States, and where she lived prior to her death.
> 
> Her facial reconstruction (large image here on Asian American News) has been done in the style of an adult man with buzzed hair, which is almost certainly not what the victim looked like when she was alive. It bears repeating that her body was found as a skeleton dressed as a woman. It is much more likely that she kept her hair long and wore makeup. If she worked in the sex trade alongside colleagues in the 2000s, there is a very good chance that she accessed estrogen and antiandrogen therapy at least informally.* Therefore, she may have had softer and rounder facial features, especially in the cheeks and lips. Even if she was known as a boy in her early teens, she may not be recognizable in an adult male depiction.
> 
> [EDIT: A commenter has linked me to a version of her facial reconstruction with added long hair.]
> 
> Given that very many trans women are rejected by their families of origin, often before their family acknowledges their female presentation, it is likely that Gilgo Beach Doe is remembered by her loved ones in two separate identities. Her family of origin and people who knew her in childhood may remember her as a teenage boy. If her life story is similar to that of many trans women, she may be distinctly remembered for having a feminine disposition or presentation. As an adult, any friends, acquaintances, or potential sex worker colleagues or clients she would have had would remember her as a woman of medium height. It is possible that some of these people may not have known she was trans. For this reason, it would be immensely helpful if a new facial reconstruction could be released of her in a women's style, possibly alongside a younger boy's style. Her current facial reconstruction is misleading and a frankly bizarre choice that probably does not reflect Gilgo Beach Doe's appearance at any point during her life.
> 
> Onto a very important point to me regarding Gilgo Beach Doe:
> 
> Newspaper articles, Reddit threads, even her Doe Network page repeat the same baseless speculation that LISK killed her because he hired her as a sex worker, discovered she was transgender, and killed her because his discovery upset him. I find it cruel and insulting to Gilgo Beach Doe to refer to her as a male and assume that if she was a sex worker, she could only have attracted a client by mistake. LISK did not need a reason to murder young women, he did so because he wanted to and he could. It is sad that this speculation insinuates that Gilgo Beach Doe, unlike other suspected LISK victims, did something to "excite" or "deserve" the rage of a killer.
> 
> This speculation also does not reflect the reality of the murders of trans sex workers by their straight male clients, who are usually completely aware that they are trans from the beginning. Transgender sex workers almost always disclose their status in online ads or work in established strolls because their trans status is a sales advantage, not the opposite. Many of their clients regularly patronize both cis and trans women in the sex trade. Like other sex workers, they are murdered because they are seen as opportunity targets and because they are a witness to whatever their client is ashamed of sexually (in this case, being attracted to trans women). Prior knowledge of trans status by the killer is known in the murders of Venus Xtravaganza (1988), Sisi Thibert (2017), Kimberly McRae (2023), Cassandra Do (2003), and Remy Fennel and Jaida Peterson (2021), to cite only a few off the top of my head.

> I hope that Gilgo Beach Doe receives renewed attention in the coming years and that her identity is eventually established. I hope that we can one day hear from people who knew her and who can say what she was like, what she enjoyed in life, and what was important to her. I hope that we come to learn not just her birth certificate name, or a prior male identity she may have been given as a child, but the name or names she used with the people close to her as an adult.
> 
> In the immediate future, I hope that the moniker "Asian Male"is no longer the default way to refer to her in casual use. While the nickname has to be attached to any article about her to maximize the chances of hits, as it is here, I would like to see Wikipedia, press statements about LISK, and discussions about her case online to adopt a gender-neutral nickname like "Gilgo Beach Doe" and stop refrring to her as a man by default. If she was a transgender teenager or young woman, working in the sex trade, exposed to violence with no access to dental care (evidenced by her missing teeth), she would have faced incredible heartbreak and trauma building a life for herself as a woman. It would really be insult added to injury for this victim to have had her life taken from her and then for LE, the press, and amateur websleuths to strip her of her dignity (along with her clothing) and call her a man based on, of all things, her skeleton. She deserves better. I hope one day her memory can be honoured.
> 
> Please let me know if there is anything about her case I have missed.
> 
> If you have any information about her case, especially if you were a colleague, client, or acquaintance of a missing transgender woman in the Long Island area in the late 1990s or 2000s who matches her description, please refer to the contact information at the bottom of her Doe Network page and/or contact the Doe Network itself.
> 
> ---
> 
> Further edit:
> 
> I have been asked to provide sources for the LE assumption regarding this victim's possible employment in the sex trade, manner of death, and trans status. The police make the inference that she was a cross-dresser who was mistaken for a cis woman. My whole argument is that while this is possible, someone who makes themselves look just like a cis woman is highly likely to be a trans woman. At the very least, this victim should be publicized looking like a female alongside the male portrait to reflect both the possibility that she was a cross-dresser and the possibility that she lived socially as a woman. I believe a gender-neutral moniker like "Gilgo Beach Doe", followed by the information about biological sex, clothing, and the possibility of a female social identity at the time of death, will help identification rather than hinder it.

> From a direct interview with Commissioner Dormer interviewed by the LISK podcast , Season 2 Episode 3, timestamp 16:34.

> "It threw me for a loop when I heard about it. I mean, we were expecting all females. It took a while for the anthropologists, the forensic people, to analyse the remains. And we find out that the Asian male - very slight build - was wearing women's clothes. Not in the database, again. But probably, the theory was, probably working as a sex worker. And connected with the killer. This is the theory, because they all end up at Gilgo Beach."

> *From my lived experience as a trans person, I can assure you there is a strict code of honour around sharing access to hormone replacement therapy between transgender people living on the margins. This is even more true amongst the sisterhood of sex workers, who know they can only count on each other to survive. If she had even one or two trans women friends working alongside her, it's very likely that they would have helped her access HRT even in an ad-hoc, irregular, or informal way.

> Edit: The 2016 A&E documentary series on the LISK, The Killing Season, features a lead provided by websleuth turned forensic artist "carlk90245" (who apparently did the forensic reconstruction for Tammy Jo Alexander). This lead is explained in more detail in this post which refers to the unidentified victim as "Ocean Parkway Doe" and states that DNA analysis has confirmed a male chromosomal sex for this Doe. I have not found official information that corroborates that, but it would be good news if true.
