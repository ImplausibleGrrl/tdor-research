The body of Elizabeth Taylor, 40, was found beneath the stairs behind a rooming house at 874 East Georgia street on the morning of 3 Nov., 1964. Her death is believed to have happened late on the 2nd.

Elizabeth was dressed in women's clothing, complete with long red opera gloves, nylon stockings, high-heel shoes, a dress, and make-up. She was well-known locally as a 'female impersonator'.

The police investigation resulted in the charging of Duncan Beaudry, 44, with her murder. The prosecution relied heavily on a confession reported by a police jail house informant where Beaudry admitted to strangling Elizabeth and dragging her body to the stairs. 

Vancouver pathologist Dr T. R. Harmon testified at the trial that Elizabeth had been strangled from behind, as well as bruising on her body. 

Duncan Beaudry was acquitted at Assize court trial on the charge of non-capitol murder, with the trial judge stating afterwards that he would not have convicted Duncan based on his drunkenness: "In my opinion he was guilty at worst of manslaughter."
