===== Beaudry acquitted in Taylor slaying =====

Ducan Beaudry has been acquitted by an Assize Court jury on a charge of non-capital murder in the Nov. 2 strangling of Larry "Elizabeth" Taylor.

The body of Taylor, well-known to police as a female impersonator, was found dressed in women's clothers under a verandah in the rear of 874 East Georgi folling a wine party.

Mr. Justice F. C. Munroe said after the trails: "If I were trying this case alone, I would not have convicted the defendant because of his drunkenness. In my opinion, was was guilty at worst of manslaughter."

Beaudry and several others had been holding an all-day and night party in the east Georgi apartment block.

James Barrisoff, and inmate in the jail cell block to which Beaudry was taken, testified he informed on him for police. Barrisoff said that the accused admitted strangling "Elizabeth" following and argument.

Beaudry, giving evidence in his own defence, denided killing Taylor. He said he was in bed with his wife at the time police allege he murdered him. His wife gave supporting testimony.

The accused said that of the six or seven persons at the drinking party, only he did not have an alibi which satisfied police. He said he blieved he was going to be made the "fall guy" and decided to fabricate a confession in which he would admit he killed Taylor, but only in self-defence. Beaudry was defended by Kennth Fawcus. Crown counsel was J. A. Margach.
