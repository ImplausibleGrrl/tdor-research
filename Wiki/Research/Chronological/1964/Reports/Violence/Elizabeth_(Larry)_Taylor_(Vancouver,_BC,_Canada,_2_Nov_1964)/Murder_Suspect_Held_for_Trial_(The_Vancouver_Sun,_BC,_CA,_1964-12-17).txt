==== Witness Tells of His Own Threat To Choke Female Impersonator ====

By KEN JOHNSON Sun Staff Reporter

A witness in a capital murder charnge preliminary hearing admitted Wednesday that he threatened to choke a man several hours before the man was found strangled in a back alley.

Granted protection under the Canada Evidence Act by Magistrate Gordon Scott, Melvin Dionne, of 874 East Georgia, told the court: "I argued with him at about 3 p.m. that day.

"I threw him to the floor and grabbed him round the neck. I said 'I'll choke you. I'll kill you right now if you don't get upstairs and stay out of my way'."

Dionne was giving evidence in the case of Duncan Beaudry, 44, also of 874 East Georgia, who is charged with capital murder of Skid Road female impersonator Larry (Elizabeth) Taylor.

Beaudry was commited folloing the hearing for trial.

=== FOUND STRANGLED ===

Taylor was found strangled in an alley beind 874 East Georgia in the early hours of Nov. 3. He was wearing women's clothin.

Dionne told the court that afgter he grabbed Taylor's neck on the afternoon of Nov. 2 the man got up and walked away.

"But I might have crushed his vocal cords," Dionne said, "I don't know."

Earlier in Wednesday's hearing, Dionne was hustled from the public gallery by a policeman when he shouted at a previous witness: "You're a lying stool pgeon."

On oath, Dionne told the court: "I was the janitor of the rooming house at 874 Eat Georgia. I had had some trouble with Taylor. He lived with Beaudry and his wife."

=== ARGUMENT ON PORCH ===

He said that about 11:30 p.m. on Nov. 2 he was lying in his suite when he hard and argument between Taylor and another man on the back porch.

"I heard Taylor say, 'Don't do this, Paul. Don't, don't," Dionne testified.

He said he did not know who Paul was, except that he had parked a blue car at the rear of the building for an hour that night.

Dionne said that after the struggle he heard someone go down the stairs from the back porch.

"I didn't even bother to see what it was," Dionne said. "I was half-drunk and had sleeping pills inside me. I just thought it was another fight. 

"We're all alcholics — including Beaudry."

The disturbances in court earlier Wednesday in which Dionne was put out of court was the first of two.

Toward the end of the hearing in the afternoon, Jean Siro, common-law wife of the accused, Beaudry, jumped up in the public gallery.

She shouted: "Duncan didn't do it." Then she stomped out of court.

The "stool pigeon" accusation made by Dionne was aimed at James Barrisoff, a prosecution witness.

Barrisoff, serving five years for forgery and false pretences charges, admitted under cross-examination that he acted as a police informer while in a jail cell with Beaudry.

=== FIGHT RECOUNTED ===

Barrisoff testified that Beaudry told him in jail he and Taylor had a fight on the porch of 874 East Georgia late Nov. 2.

"Beaudry said he hit Taylor with the back of his hand and knocked him against the wall," said Barrisoff.

"There were portions of it Beaudry couldn't remember. But he did recall a fight where he had Taylor by the neck...

"He remembered having Taylor down and having his hands on this throat. He remembered that Taylor had quit fighting and went lax.

"He started to take Taylor do the stairs but there was a commotion up in the hallway and he left the body on the second landing and went to his suite and lay on the bed."

=== CALLER'S REPORT ===

Later, Barrisoff said, another man called at the rooming house and told Beaudry he had found Taylor lying at the obttom of the stairs in the alley.

Magistrate Scott declined to dismiss the case on the representation of defence lawyer Ken Fawcus that Barrisoff's testimony was worthless.
