Transvestite is stabbed to death near the Arena do Jacaré

The crime happened around midnight on Tuesday (01/12) near the main entrance of the Arena do Jacaré stadium. According to the stadium watchman, residents of the region reportedly heard cries for help from a woman and a lot of noise in the woods. The police were called, and when arriving at the scene, the military found 41-year-old Suzana Mattano lying on the floor unconscious. The victim had several stab wounds through the body. The SAMU team was there to provide assistance, but Suzana could not resist the injuries and died.

Witness information reports that the suspects for the crime fled the scene using a dark Fox vehicle and headed towards Avenida Ecuador.

The victim used the name Suzana Mattano on social media, but was known as Tiazinha. Suzana was very dear to the LGBT community.

Another brutal crime to increase the statistics of the rampant violence in which we live in our city.
