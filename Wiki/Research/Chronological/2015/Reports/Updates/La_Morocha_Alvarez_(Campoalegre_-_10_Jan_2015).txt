"I had threatened him"

A cousin of the victim, in the first hearings of the oral trial, stated that Arnoldo had had discussions on previous occasions with Fausto Vega and he had threatened him in the beauty salon where he worked.

"On one occasion, Morocha came running to the house saying that Fausto was going to kill her with a pistol that he had and that he needed a knife or something to defend himself, when Fausto came behind him ...", the family member related in that first hearing.

He added that he faced the man, to defend his cousin. “He yelled at 'Morocha',“ around the corner we have to see each other, I won't let him live, ”said Álvarez's relative.

The witness stated that "Fausto threatened the 'Morocha' because whenever she started drinking and she came across him, she yelled at him that he had to do with the death of a brother of mine."

Likewise, the witness referred to the night of the stylist's murder, “they came to the house to tell me that‘ La Moroch’a was dead, I immediately went to the park and there everyone said that Bátalo had shot her. They had already taken her to the hospital and I went there, I saw her already dead, she had a shot in her face. Later I looked for Fausto and told him that he had killed her because of those threats that she had made about her, but he replied that her threats were out of anger, but nothing more. "
