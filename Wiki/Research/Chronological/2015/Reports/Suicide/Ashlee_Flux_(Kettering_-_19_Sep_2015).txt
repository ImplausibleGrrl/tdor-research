"Like a lot of you, I've been feeling pretty gutted about the recent election.  I've been shocked and horrified to realise the extent to which things can and probably will get worse now that it's no longer a coalition but the Conservatives on their own.  I've been first uncomprehending, then angry and misanthropic, in the face of  a group of humans getting together and deciding that it would be a good idea to get rid of the human rights act.  Misanthropic like:  OK, you all voted for this shit, fucking have it then, I hope it makes you weep.
But we didn't all vote for this.  We don't all deserve this.  
There is hope.  Not (in my opinion) hope of making this government behave more kindly to the poorest and most vulnerable people, but hope that people will do more to help each other because they can see the need to, thus mitigating the unkindness pouring down on us from those in power."
