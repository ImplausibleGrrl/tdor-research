Mac Ohana committed suicide by asphyxiation on December 2, 2015. He was a fierce activist and a dear personal friend whose struggles with mental illness took him out of this world when we were only 19. There is now a scholarship in his memory at the Western Washington University Woodring College of Education for students aspiring to, or with experience working with, high-risk youth. He was born and raised, and ultimately met his untimely death, in Bellingham, Washington.


Mac, formerly known as Maggie, Ohana graduated from Squalicum High School, attended the Bellingham Unitarian Fellowship, and was active with Northwest Youth Services. His left this life too soon, losing his long term battle with depression. He will be missed by his family: mothers Heidi and Chris, brothers Andrew and Willey, sister Ren, grandmother E.K. Butler, and many aunts, uncles and cousins. Mac had a large personality and made a huge impact on a great many people. His family and community will remember him for his advocacy of those who were homeless and those struggling with mental illness. He tried to navigate our flawed mental health care system and worked hard to change it. We hope his short life will be the catalyst for necessary change in the treatment of those in the margins of society. He was so very thankful for the support of Northwest Youth Services and donations would be greatly appreciated in lieu of flowers. A memorial service will be held Saturday, December 12, 2 p.m., at Syre Hall at Whatcom Community College.
