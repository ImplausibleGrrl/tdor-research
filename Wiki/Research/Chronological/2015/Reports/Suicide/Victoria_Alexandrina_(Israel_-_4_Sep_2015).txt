> Victoria Alexandrina (Kagan), a trans immigrant to Israel who was about to celebrate her 41st birthday this week, took her on life on Friday.
> 
> So far, information on any family she may have in Israel is unavailable and Victoria’s friends in the transgender community have expressed a desire not to reveal information on her background. All is known is that Victoria had moved to Israel by herself at 18. Her friends have expressed a hope that the sad circumstances of her death pass quietly and with respect. Some of them have switched their profile pictures to Victoria’s image over the transgender flag, with a black stripe through as a sign of mourning.
> 
> One of Victoria’s friends posted on her Facebook page, “In memoriam to all the trans women who’ve been murdered and committed suicide (which is also a form of murder) from our community each year. For every one of us who tried or considered taking her on life. Blessed be her memory.”
> 
> “I sit in front of your pictures and imagine how in a parallel world I would have hugged you and said ‘why did you do this? why did you leave? you are such a good person,” mourned Daniel Brosh, a leading trans activist.
> 
> “I know why you did it,” Daniel continued, “we live in a rotten reality. A reality where it’s not enough that you are excluded because you weren’t born here. You are being excluded not only because you are a woman, but because you are a trans woman. And I’m so sad to think that people see it as a cross to bear, as suffering. Why? Why can’t this definition be just like the definition of color of one’s hair or the size of one’s shoes?”
> 
> On Monday, September 7, the trans community gathered at the LGBT center in Tel Aviv for an “alternative Shiva,” to share memories about Victoria, and describe, in their own words, how strong and kind she was.
> 
> “Victoria has died long time before,” said one of her friends at the memorial gathering, “she was fed up with life and didn’t want any help. But still, if a certified person had identify that, her suicide could have been prevented. The message that should be learned, though, is how hard it is to be a transgender person in our current society. We are not being accepted as equal.”
> 
> According to a study by the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and the Williams Institute, which analyzed results from the National Transgender Discrimination Survey, suicide attempts are alarmingly common among transgender individuals such as Lampe; 41% try to kill themselves at some point in their lives, compared with 4.6% of the general public.

> DanVeg, a known transgender queer activist, took her own life on Friday, leaving the Israeli LGBTQ community in shock.
> 
> “DanVeg has fought for many years,” wrote her friends in the announcement of her passing, “She fought transphobia and homophobia, she fought against sexism, racism and boredom, and like many of us, she fought with chasms of depression and thoughts of suicide, to which our society stubbornly pushes anyone who dares to defy its gender rules.”
> 
> DanVeg, originally from Petach Tikva, took her own life on Friday night. The funeral was held on Sunday. Her friends, who shared an apartment with her in Rehovot, sit Shiva and welcome anyone who cared about her, as of Monday.
> 
> “Rest in mess and noise,” her roommate wrote, “because peace and quite was never your thing.”
> 
> In 2014, DanVeg lead a protest against taxi drivers who refused to take passengers because of physical appearance. Her latest contribution to the community was writing and editing Wikipedia entries related to the LGBT community. Two weeks ago she completed her last entry, about organization Aleph, a known 1990’s lesbian Israeli organization.
> 
> “I insist on standing out and being seen for that transqueer boy who told me how much courage I gave him, or the genderqueer girl who is empowered by it,” DanVeg once wrote on her blog. “I want them to see me and know I exist. I don’t want to lie to them and tell them that it’s easy. It’s not. It’s very hard and sometimes it’s unbearable and impossible. People are stupid, ignorant and fearful and full of hatred and violence, and you will have to face it. But I’d like you to know, I’d like to shout it, I’d like to spray it on the walls and engrave it on tables and write it and say it, and repeat it and vomit it and cry it: You are not alone. You are not alone! You are f**ing not alone!!!”

> DanVeg is the fourth known case of transgender suicide in the past year and a half. In September 2015 Victoria Alexandrina Kagan, a trans immigrant to Israel took her on life shortly after her birthday; May Peleg, a prominent Israeli activist, was found dead in November 2015 in a motel in Jerusalem; In December 2015 Barak Keshet, a 21 year old, took his own life.
