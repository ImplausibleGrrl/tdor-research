> Batato Barea: 30 years without the instant art and poetry of the literary transvestite clown
> He was one of the main underworld figures in the 80s and took the symbiosis between art and life to the extreme. His works with Alejandro Urdapilleta and Humberto Tortonese exploded with fun and ease. He died on December 6, 1991: he was 30 years old
> December 5, 2021
> 
> One of the Batato Batea dresses that was exhibited in a museum has buttons of all colors, or almost all, sewn on red and blue flowers. It is a delicate and at the same time traditional piece, from the neighborhood, simile hearth whose marble-colored fabric serves as a surface for the colorful display of the mother-of-pearl of the little buttons. Costumbrista surface for the chromatic and brilliant explosion.
> 
> There is something of that in the intense and brief passage of Batato, Walter Barea , through the Buenos Aires art scene. He shone in spite of himself. I have renewed without wanting it. His impulse was stripped nonconformity, without grandiose slogans. And when walking through the Argentine stages, he always preferred the “shoulder”, as an unstable and safe place at the same time. The Argentine theater should have trembled with his stealthy appearance, it was not like that. But 30 years after his death, which takes place on December 6, we continue to reverberate his performances.
> 
> Life and work
> 
> Batato was born in Junín in 1961 and from a very young age he moved under the involuntary influence of his brother Ariel, the youngest of the Barea, who left a mark on him with his death, a suicide in his early adolescence.

> From then on, Walter's life changed. That boy, the quietest, most careful and low-key who was silently dazzled when he saw Ariel dressed in a cousin's dresses, painted nails, rouge, and heels; that child who later became Batato, was absorbed by the tragedy of Ariel, who was killed one Sunday after lunch while Batato was doing his military service. It was November 1, 1981.
> 
> The Barea brothers had moved to Buenos Aires to breathe. So it was in the late 70s, while the parents stayed in San Miguel. In the Buenos Aires city the mother, renamed by Batato himself as "Nené Bache", ran two businesses with her husband, one of them was a party room with a kitsch aroma where the brothers mingled with glitter, balloons and garlands. Perhaps that's where the boy Walter got his love for using all kinds of materials to put together his wardrobe, most of which were scraps from the cloth shops in the Once neighborhood. Although he also did it because he had no money. "His style was stripped - account Infobae writer and artist Fernando Noy-Born of the surgeon he was because he loved to rummage through the garbage. I hated the fagots like the use of a lot of glitter, feather and sequins ”.
> 
> In Buenos Aires, Ariel leaned towards hairdressing until he got to set up his small salon which he called "Yoli Hairstyles", a tribute to the neighborhood hairdresser even though he had been trained in Llongueras. Batato, meanwhile, wandered among various occupations in passing: deli vendor, cadet, greengrocer, butcher, or masseur. One gets the impression that this constellation of tasks finally served her because she claimed everything as a great vital collage. In Batato there was no difference between art and life. It just didn't work out that way.

> He participated in various artistic presentations since 1982. But when he met Cristina Moreira , a teacher of clowns and actors, and entered the world of the clown, Batato was dazzled. He began to know the body, his body, not as a mediation with the scene but as the bridge that would bring down the famous fourth wall. Batato realized from those classes with Moreira that the traditional scene was not his. From this study group was born “El clú del claun”, a group that performed until well into the 90s, in Argentina and abroad. Shortly after, “Los peinados Yoli” came along with Tino Tinto, Patricia Gatti and Mario Filgueiras.At that time, Batato called himself "Billy Boedo" and at night he went to work as a taxi boy. Later, the actress Divina Gloria and Ronnie Arias joined this group of incipient transvestism, songs and dance of an experimental tone .
> 
> Some images paint him as a determined human being, serenely firm, stubborn, brave. A cousin remembers him riding without a saddle and wearing lamé pants, in a testimony that appears in the famous book by Fernando Noy , his friend, I swear to you by Batato . The young Walter wore tight jogging when he was very young, a rare garment at the time when he convinced Pepe Cibrián (h) to incorporate him as an assistant director in the Calígula setting . Or when he arrived at Ruth Benzacar in a dress and bare back. That tall and strong young man immediately caught the attention of María Elena Walsh,who was at the opening of the art gallery. Some time later the great Argentine poet would speak of him as "a saint", in dialogue with Noy.
> 
> He always carried notebooks, where he recorded all kinds of things. In his first years in the Buenos Aires art scene, he took them everywhere but almost never showed his writings. All his work was documented in a work diary, from 1979 to 1991, as highlighted by the researcher Guillermina Bevacqua . "He methodically wrote down all the films he saw, with a technical sheet, we would say, it was a way of recording his life," recalls Peter Pank , one of the directors of The Batato film that can be seen on YouTube.

> Trailer of "The movie of Batato"
> He was sad and cordial like a legitimate Argentine, if we steal Raúl González Tuñón's words . Hence his own identity, the one he always claimed: clown. “I remember accompanying Batato through the streets of Abasto and where there was a vacant lot with garbage, he would go in - says actress and singer Karina K - he would gather some curtain voile fabrics and a nightstand screen and take them home. . Within weeks I would see it on the cover of Viva magazine, Batato, surrounded by top models, sitting as on a throne and with that same lampshade that he found in the vacant lot, placed inverted on his head and dressed with part of those dirty curtains from the garbage dump. That spirit was the 80's, in a country that was emerging in its new democracy, the first steps of a gender identity that Batato knew so much to vindicate, with his art, his speech and his poetry ”.
> 
> He was one of the main figures of some of the underground temples (or "paste" as Batato, Urdapilleta, Noy and others called the new artistic currents), the Parakultural, also Cement. And soon he would appear on TV, in Antonio Gasalla's comedy programs or in “A la cama con Moria” , where amidst shared pouts he said that he had never been with women but “he would do it with Moria, Juana Molina, María Elena Walsh and Hebe de Bonafini ”.
> 
> Batato, in the program of Antonio Gasalla, in 1988
> His trios together with Alejandro Urdapilleta and Humberto Tortonese exploded with fun, ease, poetry, performances, humor, and clownish spirit. Anyway, it was something new. Something to be expected, however. They did Involucrados , then Las Coperas and many more. They were brief interventions and sometimes the grace - as Urdapilleta once recalled - "was that the play lasted five minutes." Batato invented scenes, as once in which the argument was that he suffered a disease for which he could go on stage but could not go down. "And there he stayed a long time", recreates María José Gabin , one of the girls from the mythical group "Gambas al Ajillo" who also performed at the Parakultural. "His was an unnerving humor . It was not a humor that you laughed to death. He was like being-art. He was very genuine. " Or a kind of performance where people observed how he looked at himself on a rickety television. “Urda” recounted: “once we said let's do a bad, heavy work, like the ones we hated. It was called The Fall of the Feather . We made it up on poems by Alejandra Pizarnik . It was so boring and people loved it. It was a search for freedom and exercising freedom was having fun ”.
> 
> The poets appeared soon. The already mentioned Pizarnik, Marosa di Giorgio, Susana Thénon, Irene Gruss, Olga Orozco, Alfonsina Storni, Juana de Ibarbourou . Batato was a great reader of poetry and he gradually incorporated them into his performances, along with Tortonese and Urdapilleta. Noy commented during an event at the MALBA museum this year that “you reached a place where poetry was not simply a text. Poetry was an instant, a reality. The poetry was not in the book. Poetry had fled from that irreverent place of these three women to the carnality of each of those who were in the audience ”. The Infobae chronicle alludes to the cycle "History as rumor" curated by the writer Laura Ramos .

> Again his friend Urdapilleta, who also died very young in 2013, stated it in his own words, “he was a serious person and he was a clown”, a phrase that can be heard in La peli de Batato . Peter Pank tells us that he met him in Cement. “I was doing a performance. It was covered with a cloth and you would guess your luck. When he finished he gave you a card that said "I am Batato", with a poem by Pizarnik and his telephone number ".
> 
> I wonder and wonder why the stampede of the 80s is still present. A set of dissimilar, contradictory, explosive expressions that spread through that Buenos Aires still straddling the performative sixties, the dictatorship and these new eighties horsemen who avoided the bar La Paz and they preferred the edge as a place of exhibition. The pastiche, the superposition of styles, the suddenness and a myriad of ridiculous things coexisted on stage. The so-called “under” was so strong that not only the shreds remain. The work remains. The archives, the memorabilias, the Museums that invoke that do that seemed perishable remain. And when I say "work", I think that the makers of that time would never have referred to their work with this term. Art was lived in the body and that decade was the first explosion. These artists wondered, like Ecclesiastes, how to continue living since nothing in life is certain except death. An axiom that became torn flesh during the dictatorship, without whose existence, perhaps, the movement under the 80s would not have been as it was.
> 
> Karina K remembers it. “I lived it as a belle epoque , a need to reset culture, after so much darkness and injustice at the hands of the military. All post-dictatorship arts represented a need for visibility and poetic discourse and at the same time transgressive. The young people of that time needed the meeting and the alliance to project ideas and materialize them with the minimum resources but with the most absolute wealth of creativity. The under was that, with the minimum give the maximum ”.
> 
> "What he did not like actors and the world of theater in general, was also the result of an era, says Guillermo Angelelli, his partner at the Clú del Claun. There was Open Theater, the official theater, the commercial one. The independent theater began to gain strength from the 80s. The reference that we had from the acting was a bit loaded with solemnity. Much was put in the word and little in the body, in the action. It was quite a moment, like the development of dance - theater. The theater is beginning to open up to other languages ??”.

> “I mark a thread, 60 -70 -80 as part of an“ analog ”end of the century. The 90's is something else ”. María José Gabin analyzes for Infobae that “it was something between the happening, the post-avant-garde, the Di Tella of the 60s, the performance, the installations, the most politicized theater of the 70s and the modern varieté of the 80s. It is totally linked. Ours was political but in another sense. More political partner. He was not a supporter. There is a very strong presence of humor, the breaking of the fourth wall is radical. We left the basements of the dictatorship and entered the basement of the Parakultural . It was counter-hegemonic ”.
> 
> There was no trajectory for Batato, no stage, no play. What we commonly call art, Batato put in the body as a tool with an other and with an external whole, and called it "life." "We were homosexuals, dancers, colorful, crazy," once commented the late Tino Tinto, a member of "Los Peinados Yoli."
> 
> In 1985, the Urda-Batato duo ventured into an atypical program at midnight on Channel 7, Noche de Brujas , hosted by journalist Alicia Barrios . "They were crazy, transgressors, they dressed strangely." Barrios says that the deputy director of the channel at that time conveyed an alleged anger to him from Raúl Alfonsín , the president of the Nation at that time, for their audacity. And the comedians were erased at a stroke. “We shit with laughter with his interventions. We had a great time, but I lived with the edge of having the program lifted at some point. There was always a channel manager hanging around the studio where we recorded ”.
> 
> Batato rehearsed many of his presentations at the PH in which he lived, the one his mother had bought him, on Tucumán street, in the Abasto neighborhood. The Mercado de Abasto as such still existed, then closed, and not the shopping that we porteños knew how to get. The neighborhood conserved its sieve of compadritos and some cutlers. But in the 80s the bustle of the huge fruit and vegetable market had died down so that little by little the artists arrived.
> 
> Literary transvestite clown
> 
> The PH was the last apartment of a chorizo ??house. Two environments. A staircase to the terrace. Little space for the kitchen and bathroom. A bed as an armchair-sofa. An old TV on a table from the 70s, the radio recorder, many magazines, books, a lamp with handkerchiefs as a screen and a lot of cloth, tulle and all kinds of gadgets that later became wardrobes. Locker room with women's clothing up and down the stage.
> 
> "We were going on tour, a flight to Colombia," says Angelelli. And he arrived at the Ezeiza airport with a suitcase that Nené, the mother, had packed for him. He had put a wooden platform on the bottom, with wheels. And a strap. He in black palazzo pants, a silver sleeveless blouse, loose hair and makeup. It was the first time we had seen him dressed as a woman. On the plane he had to sit in the middle of a group of rugby players because we were separated. Little by little she was changing or removing her makeup. She went to the bathroom and tied her hair up because she was ashamed. On another trip she wore a transparent tunic and a thong below. In the middle of the Latin American theater festival that was unusual. Everyone ended up loving him. It was that honesty thing. People empathized out of admiration ”.
> 
> For many, this transformation of Batato comes to the desired moment when he puts on his boobs. Fernando Noy tells it in a loving way. “He had a friend who was Pochocha, a transvestite from the neighborhood. I was with Walter (Batato) and Pochocha arrived with two divine chongos. He saw how the chongos were looking at her tits. When they left, Batato told me 'I want that. That look of desire on me. I was concerned because I knew this was going to hasten his end. He did it to attract men and the funny thing is that afterwards he wore t-shirts, because he was ashamed ”.
> 
> There are no coincidences on whether he used prosthetics, silicones or industrial oil. “One night I decided to put my boobs on. I decided it in a minute, "says Batato in La peli de Batato . Without thinking too much. It cost me a lot, once done it gave me anguish. I look in the mirror and say 'sure, it's weird'. The good thing that guys say compliments to you. The first thing guys see are the boobs ”. For Urdapilleta "putting on her boobs was an ideology, the ideology of breaking himself."
> 
> “Through his character on stage he discovered himself. He was his own performance product, reflects Angelelli. It was an adventure to come to life with him ”.
> 
> For María José Gabin “when she put on the prostheses it was like the extreme of her self-perception. But it was cheap with prosthetics. It was not a transvestite. It was a bit of an androgynous thing ”.

> Boobs or no boobs, Batato was the clown. Even without the clown's red nose, it was pulled out as an act of detachment. He was naked on stage. He was himself, not a character. I saw him one night in the Parakultural, dark and damp lovable basement, dancing to Marilina Ross songs . Arms outstretched. Spinning on itself, like a Sufi dance. Sandals with heels and in a movement like a slide he finished with his emphatic body of a boy on the improvised stalls. And he took a spectator to the stage to keep dancing, dancing, dancing.
> 
> Montevideo and the end
> 
> The most vivid testimony of his final days, sick with AIDS, was given by the late Tino Tinto , in the Peter Pank and Goyo Anchou film . “We traveled to Montevideo to present La Carancha at a theater festival. The first image I remember was ghostly. He had actually traveled because he wanted to meet Marosa di Giorgio, the Uruguayan poet. The performance was tremendous, even at one point he stumbled. Then we went for a walk along the coast, he told me "tomorrow is going to be a good day, there will be sun." When we got back to the hotel, he was delirious. He told me ´one is high with words and the other is high with poetry´. When he was admitted, I went to see him. He had on a round neck shirt with buttons and it had them detached. She asked me to button them because you could see her boobs. That thing of modesty, like a child. The next day he died at 10 ".
> 
> Batato had left indications for his wake. They dressed him in a new green robe. They made it up, they fixed it. “The wake was on Córdoba street. Sergio Avello , a plastic artist, made him a cross of celestial globes. Batato also mounted his wake. It was like a royal . He knew he was going to die ”, recalls Fernando Noy. Thus they traveled, with the box in a truck, to Junín, where he is buried with his entire family. Adds Noy: "The Great Markova once told me, 'Do you know what it has as a plus? He really was a provincial girl. "
> 
> Batato with Urdapilleta
> “It was a huge loss, says María José Gabin . Batato was a postmodern clown. I would not pigeonhole him into the traditional clown world. His being was art. There the division between life and art is broken ”.
> 
> Something that was found among his papers was a poem. According to his mother, written shortly before his death. “It cannot be / You cannot be / The time was short to leave what I wanted / I only left what I could. (…) Life, you who denied me being alive / you will not be able to deny me my inheritance / which is my body / I take it with death / that is enough what I leave behind ”.
