===== MURDER OR SUICIDE =====

PAXTON, ILL, Nov. 30.—//Special Item//—
The body of a man, clothed like a woman, with his throat cut from ear to ear, was discovered in a car on the Illinois Central railroad this morning. Everything in the case seemed to give the impression that the man had been foully mudered, althought it may possibly may have been a suicide. A razor and a torn $5 bill were found in the car.  An envelope in his clothes gave the name James Smith, of Litchfield Ill. and, in reply to a telegram the authrorities there announced that a man by that name was paid the wages due hime, as amounting to $48, on the 22d inst. He had dark hair, a mustache of lighter color, and weighed about 150 pounds. The coroner's jury now has the matter in charge, and is making a thorough investigation
