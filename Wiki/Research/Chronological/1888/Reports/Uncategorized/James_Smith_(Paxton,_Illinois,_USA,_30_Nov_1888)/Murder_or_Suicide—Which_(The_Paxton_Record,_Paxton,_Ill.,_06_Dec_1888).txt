===== MURDER OR SUICIDE—WHICH? =====

==== The Body of a Dead Man, with Throat Cut from Ear to Ear, Found in a Freight Car on the I.C.R.R. Side Track ====

On Friday morning last no little excitement was created by the discovery by two little boys of the dead body of a man in a box car on the side track on Railroad Avenue, and very soon a stream of humanity was pouring towards the car to see the horrible sight. The body lay on its back in front of the doors, one of which was partially open. The southern end of the car presented the appearance of a slaughter house. A pool of blood, apparently from one to two gallons, had coagulated in a small space and had filtered through the floor, forming a pool on the the ground beneath the car. In the blood was an open razor with which the wound had evidently been inflicted, and on the floor of the car was a five dollar silver certificate torn into several pieces. A letter had  also been torn up and scattered over the car floor, and an unused ticket over the Wabash Road fro Litchfield to Chicago, dated Nov. 23. In the vicinity of the body there was little or no blood, and this, together with the fact that the body was found thirteen feet from the spot where apparently the last drop of lifeblood had flowed, impressed spectators generally with the impression that a foul murder had been committed. Esq. McElroy, being notified, summoned as a jury to investigated the cause of death, L. B. Farrar, foreman; J. L. Larkin, S. T. Wier, T. J. Larson, P.L. Strong and Geo. Grove.

Upon searching the body, a letter was found bearing date of Inianapolis, Sep. 15th, 1888, which was evidently written in reply to a question as to his dues to the Brotherhood of Machiery Mounders, from which order he had been suspended. On his person were also found several tools used by moulders and two folding rules, used by mechanics.

A despatch was forwarded to the authorities at Litchfield, and a reply received that a man of that name had been paid off at the shops in that place on the 22d ult. This was considered by the jury to establish the identity of the deceased with reasonable certainity, but a despatch was also sent to R. J. McNamara, the writer of the above letter, at Indianapolis, which failed to evoke any response. The jury held two sessions on Friday and continued them on Satureday and Sunday, following up all clues and examining several experts, and finally arrived at the following verdict:

That the said supposed James Smith came to his death by voluntarily inflicting a mortal wound upon himself with a razor.

The impression is very strong in the public mind that the case was one of murder, despite the verdict, though no doubt the evidence before the jury justified their finding. Credible persons report hearing cries of distress during the night. The disappearance during of the night of two colored tramps who claimed to be selling razors, the finding of the body at so great a distance from the spot where the blodd flowed, while none or very litle was beside the body, all are cited as against the theory of suicide.

A strange feature of the case is that the friends of Smith at Litchfield and Indianapolis manifest no interest in his fate, leaving his body to be buried in the potter's field at public expense.

The verdict should not so satisfy our authorities as to cause the to relax vigilance in seeking out the bottom facts in the case.
