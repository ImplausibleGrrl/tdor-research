On the morning of Friday, 30 Nov., 1888, the body of James Smith, dressed in women's clothing[[+Murder or Suicide (The Inter Ocean, Chicago, Ill., 01 Dec 1888)|[1]]], of Litchfield, Illinois, was discovered in a railroad box car on a side-track in Paxton, Illinois, by two young boys. The body was decomposed and had had its throat cut from ear to ear with a razor. The body had been drained of nearly all blood and was found 13 feet away from where 1 to 2 gallons of blood had drained and coagulated.

A coroner's jury was convened and issued the verdict that the death was a suicide. This verdict appears at odds with the large seperation between the body and the pool of blood and many people were skeptical of the verdict as being physically implausible. There were two men alleged to have been selling razors who disappeared around the time of the discovery of the body. There were also reports of sounds of distress that had been heard from the area of the box car prior to the discovery of the body.
