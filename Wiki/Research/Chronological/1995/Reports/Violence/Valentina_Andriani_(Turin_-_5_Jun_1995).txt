> It is Umberto Prinzi, the murderer of the transsexual Valentina, the man found lifeless this morning, December 14, in the street of Santa Brigida, on the hill of Moncalieri , in the province of Turin. The body was in the bush about a meter from the roadway and had a wound at the nape of the neck. He had no documents and the carabinieri identified him with fingerprints. Prinzi, 47 year-old native of Carignano, was sentenced to 22 years for the murder of Valentina, transsexual of Pugliese origins disappeared in vain in 1995. At the time the investigators were immediately convinced that she had been killed and suspects immediately fell on Prinzi, with which Valentina lived in an apartment in via Ghemme.

> 
> Confession after 12 years
> Only after 12 years, with a final sentence already on his shoulders, the former Turin waiter confessed that he had strangled her and had the body found again. He had wrapped it in the plastic sheet of a camping cupboard and thrown it into a slope. After serving almost the whole sentence he had returned to freedom and he had lost track of it until this morning, when a passerby noticed a motionless body on the edge of the roadway. Initially it was thought of an investment by a pirate of the road, but no traces of braking or bodywork were found on the asphalt.
> 
> The prosecution investigates murder
> The alarm was launched around 9.30 and in the streets of Santa Brigida arrived local police officers, the carabinieri and pm Laura Longo. The prosecution investigates murder, to allow for extensive investigations, but at the moment other hypotheses are not excluded. For the time being, the coroner has set the hour of death at around 6 am, but the residents of the luxury villas in the area have not heard any suspicious noise. The body may have been unloaded from a car and some witnesses reported seeing a car descend at full speed towards the center of Moncalieri. To solve the yellow of the hill, the investigators are waiting for the results of the autopsy and are viewing the images recorded by some video surveillance cameras in the area.


> It'was identified  a man of about 47 years found dead this morning in Santa Brigida road, at number 43 near the Manzoni school, at  Moncalieri .
> 
> PRESUMED MURDER
> This is  Umberto Prinzi who, in 1995, killed the trans Cosimo Andriani by throwing him into a crevasse in Val di Lanzo. The causes of death at the moment are not clear, but from the first findings the corpse seems to have bruising around the neck compatible with a strangulation. The Turin prosecutor has opened a file for murder .
> 
> FROM ONE YEAR HE WAS DISCOUNTED THE PENALTY
> The investigations are coordinated by the pm Laura Longo. The crime of Cosimo Andriani, known as Valentina , took place on May 1, 1995. Born in Molfetta (Bari) and immigrated to Turin in 1978, he managed to turn his body into a female body with a series of surgical interventions. The same path had followed his brother Antonio, victim of a murder in 1991, in Turin, by two young men. Valentina became a prostitute and had managed to accumulate a good fortune (800 million lire, in addition to furs and jewels). When she was killed she was 32 years old. The remains of the trans were found at the bottom of a crevasse only in January 2007. In his confession, Prinzi claimed to have committed the crime for passionate reasons. Sentenced to 22 years, he was released from prison in October last year.

In a photo the cold rawness of evil: when in Val di Viù, after 12 years, the body of Valentina was found
The chronicles of yesterday, the challenges of today
In a photo the cold rawness of evil: when in Val di Viù, after 12 years, the body of Valentina was found
Then there is the Turin-Ceres to dominate the news of the Awakening, reporting inconveniences and inefficiencies but also the projects destined to change the line in a journey into the future of local transport
New episode of the column, between history and amarcord, which presents, in these months celebrating the 100 years of our magazine that will culminate in a big party in June and in various editorial and non-editorial initiatives, a substantial "selection" of the first pages that have opened the newspaper in its first century of life

One cold December morning, a cell phone from the prison police climbs through the hairpin bends of the Viù valley. Escorted by the men of the flying squad, a man in handcuffs comes out: it is Umberto Prinzi. In prison in Ivrea he is serving a 22-year sentence for the murder of Cosimo Andriani, a trans, known as Valentina, whom Prinzi had met in January 1995 in a nightclub in Turin. The two fall in love and decide to move in together. A few months later, Valentina disappears into thin air. Investigations start: the circle tightens around Prinzi but there are only clues against the man.

The judges still convict him of murder but Valentina's body will never be found. On January 26, 2007, while serving her detention, Prinzi admits to having killed her and confesses to the investigators the place where she threw the body. On January 31, in a locality between Pian Bausano and Castagnole, on a cliff, the remains of Valentina are recovered, wrapped in a plastic sheet. Thus ends a drama that began twelve years earlier. It would be jealousy that triggered Prinzi's killing spree.

A story in strong colors, made even more crude by the images published in the Awakening. The photographer's eye caught the forensics men as they open the plastic sheet with what remains of Valentina's remains inside. A photo that today, due to a changed sensitivity and the new ethical rules, would no longer be published.

The history of the Awakening intersects with the Turin-Ceres railway line, the link between the villages of the Lanzo valleys, a holiday resort loved by the Savoy bourgeoisie, Ciriè and the Piedmontese capital. The construction of the line dates back to 18 April 1868 when the inaugural ribbon of the first section between the Turin Ponte Mosca and Venaria station was cut. The following year the train arrives in Ciriè. In 1916 the section was completed up to Ceres. An essential link for the local economy: the peasants of the valleys and of the Ciriacese area sold their products at Porta Palazzo, getting off at the station just a few meters from the large city market.

Over the years the chessboard of the stations has changed and the local transport network is destined to change again. Work on the railway link is nearing completion: with the excavation of the tunnel under Corso Grosseto, the Turin-Ceres line will be connected with the Porta Susa station and with the center of the Piedmontese capital, continuing to the Lingotto.

The transformations of the railway line, the inconveniences and delays that commuters sometimes have to endure have been described in detail by the Awakening. In November 2008 the newspaper dedicated a page to the reopening of the line between Germagnano and Ceres, closed after the damage caused by the 1993 flood and refurbished. A route that should be further enhanced, exploiting it to lead visitors to discover the naturalistic and landscape beauties of the Valleys in the name of green tourism.




Valentina had disappeared in May '95 but the official report of her disappearance bears the date of June 5. At midday on May 1, he had last called his sister Agnese for the last time. Then silence. Five phone calls had left from his cell phone: Umberto Prinzi had made them, who had also engaged Valentina's furs at Monte dei Pegni. On September 4, the Clio di Valentina was found in Piazza Savoia and in November ' 96 the Squadra Mobile had finally arrested Umberto Prinzi. Against him there was also the testimony of a first cousin, Marai Ferrari, who told the agents that Umberto had confided the murder to her: "He quarreled with her, he took her by the neck. He didn't want to kill her but he strangled her. He buried the body and took the jewels. " But later he had taken everything back. Thus began the long trial and the prosecutor Enrica Gabetta after a debate full of twists and despite not having ever found Valentina's corpse had managed to obtain the sentence of the murderer at twenty-four years, then reduced to twenty-two. The story ended like this: with useless excavations in the Viù valley and the feeling that perhaps Valentina would never find anything again.



That pair of brothers and sisters who arrived from Puglia and ended badly
They arrived in Turin for the first time in 1980. Then they were still called Antonio and Cosimo Andriani but inside they already felt they were Asha and Valentina. They had left Molfetta for a vacation. "He liked the city and they had decided to stay," explained his sister Agnese sixteen years ago. In Puglia they had left their parents and prejudices. "In the family, however, we had accepted their choice - said Agnese who lived with her husband in Turin - We were ten brothers: five boys and five girls but only at the registry office. In fact, he soon realized that I had six sisters. ' Those two sisters imprisoned in male bodies had made a fortune. They had both bought the house, accumulated a fortune (Asha had deposited 500 million in the current account, Valentina even 800). And above all they had changed: long, very black hair, bilious eyes, prosperous breasts. Impossible to recognize in them the two brothers who left Molfetta. All of them were sold on the pavement: one on one side of Corso Ferrucci, the other on the other. On the evening of February 14, 1991, the street where Asha used to appear covered only by a net under her fur became the trap in which her killers closed her. He got into a blue Renault that evening Asha. He knew Corrado Giordano, the boy who led her. He also trusted Paolo Scialuga who sat behind him in silence and who shortly afterwards would have fired a shot in the back of the neck with a Luger brought from Switzerland and tried just before against the trees of Villastellone. His body was unloaded in front of the gate of a garage in via Sangano. The two "good" boys tried to burn the car, simulated the theft of the car then confessed. «I shot myself, I had Corrado's gun next to him. She was sitting in front. I felt the unstoppable urge to shoot him. I don't know why ... »admitted Paolo Scialuga who got away with a six-year sentence. Valentina cried when she heard of Asha's death. "The road is scary, I'm afraid of ending up the same way," she said through tears. He did not know that fate had something even more terrible in store for her. That it was not one night's stranger who killed her, but the man he introduced as her boyfriend. Umberto Prinzi had met him in a nightclub. Before there had been other "boyfriends": timidoni who fell in love with her and taught her to fill checks and open an account at the counter. And that in court they remembered: "She put the money in a pouffe in bulk." But like Asha every month Valentina also sent 300 thousand lire to Molfetta. "To help our parents pay the rent," said Agnese. Valentina had disappeared in May '95 but the official report of her disappearance bears the date of June 5. At midday on May 1, he had last called his sister Agnese for the last time. Then silence. Five phone calls had left from his cell phone: Umberto Prinzi had made them, who had also engaged Valentina's furs at Monte dei Pegni. On September 4, the Clio di Valentina was found in Piazza Savoia and in November ' 96 the Squadra Mobile had finally arrested Umberto Prinzi. Against him there was also the testimony of a first cousin, Marai Ferrari, who told the agents that Umberto had confided the murder to her: "He quarreled with her, he took her by the neck. He didn't want to kill her but he strangled her. He buried the body and took the jewels. " But later he had taken everything back. Thus began the long trial and the prosecutor Enrica Gabetta after a debate full of twists and despite not having ever found Valentina's corpse had managed to obtain the sentence of the murderer at twenty-four years, then reduced to twenty-two. The story ended like this: with useless excavations in the Viù valley and the feeling that perhaps Valentina would never find anything again.

A sad story. Or a very bad story, it depends on the point of view. He remembered the transmission " criminal love " on Wednesday evening on Rai Tre .

Usual horrendous vicissitude of violence, like the many of these days and the countless ones still hidden in the archives of the cold houses , occasionally fished by the mass media. Usual affair if it were not that the two victims came from Molfetta.

Late in the 70s, Antonio and Cosimo Andriani little more than teenagers left Molfetta for Turin. But in Turin Antonio and Cosimo become Asha and Valentina, they make life and money, a lot of money, and in Molfetta they never return.

On TV a host of lawyers and journalists explain who Asha and Valentina were, how they lived, what they wanted from life. On TV even a single sister, still heartbroken by the pain of the loss.

But what happened in Turin? Asha dies of an accidental shot, so he said to himself, shot by a client. And this is already a bad and strange story. Valentina is murdered, a few years later, by the man who could call herself her partner, in a quarrel of the usual, but perhaps more violent. Then, wrapped in a plastic clothes case, she is thrown down a cliff and forgotten there for more than ten years. His executioner, arrested and tried even without having found the body, will deny until the remains are found in 2007.

A sad story, a great bad story.

A true motive has not yet been focused, but it could be the grudge for a nuanced deal of luxury watches. Antonio Serra, 47, and Nicola Termine, 51, both resident in Turin, ended up in handcuffs. Both of you are prejudiced. The former was tracked down at home, the latter is in a dormitory, because he has no domicile. They were arrested by the carabinieri of the Turin Investigative nucleus on detention of a crime suspect, issued by the prosecutor Laura Longo, on the charge of being the killers of Umberto Prinzi , the man found dead on the Moncalieri hill last December 14. Given their lifestyle, the risk of escape was very high. So the catch was triggered.

The murder weapon has not yet been found.
