Early on the morning of 11 July, 1960, Mozelle Riley, 19, and three companions were walking along Drouve street in Bridgeport, Connecticut after having had a meal at Hall's restaurant. They were attacked on the street outside the restaurant by James Bennett, 22, and Clarence Love, 24, with Mozelle stabbed multiple times with an 8-inch screwdriver by Bennet, with the fatal wound being a stab directly to the heart.

Police captured Bennett and Love about 20 minutes after the slaying and Bennet was charged in the murder of Mozelle. Bennett was charged with 2nd degree murder by a Grand Jury. 

In January of 1961 Bennett pled guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to 8-10 years in prison.
