stabbed
NOT ON TDOR LIST

COLIMA, Col. (apro) .- Fifteen years after the murder of a transgender woman, known as “La Vanessa”, a 40-year-old man was arrested as the alleged perpetrator of the act, which he would have committed in the company of another individual who at the time he was tried and sentenced to prison.

The State Attorney General's Office (FGE) reported that the arrest was made in compliance with the arrest warrant issued by a judge, for authorship and participation in the qualified homicide committed on the road that leads to the community of El Chivato, in the municipality. from Villa de Álvarez.

According to the investigation carried out by the Public Ministry, the event occurred in June 2005, when the accused and his accomplice lived with the victim and, after a fight, attacked her with a sharp weapon.

On that occasion, the then State Attorney General's Office (PGJE) reported that “La Vanessa” received 39 stab wounds in various areas of her body, and that she was found in the vicinity of the soccer field of the Sports Unit of the National Union of Education Workers (SNTE).

Months before her death, the victim had filed a complaint with the Colima State Human Rights Commission (CDHEC) against police officers who harassed her and arbitrarily detained her for walking down the street in women's clothing.

After the murder, a 22-year-old man was arrested for his participation in the events. Almost a decade and a half later, the arrest warrant was executed against the second alleged suspect, who is already being held at the Colima Social Reintegration Center (Cereso) at the disposal of a judge who will define his legal situation.

An Argentine transsexual is murdered in her home for possible theft reasons

Buenos Aires, (Télam and Web ) .- Investigators of the crime of a transsexual that occurred a few days ago in the Buenos Aires neighborhood of Caballito look for the author of the homicide among her regular clients and suspect that the murder occurred when the victim tried to resist a robbery, police sources reported.  

The crime of the transsexual M. Brites, 30, occurred last Friday in the house that she rented a few meters from the train station in the Caballito neighborhood.  

The trans girl presented a strong blow to the head caused by a hard object that was not found at the crime scene and the body was found in the room of the house.  

Investigators detected the missing of some electrical appliances and valuables, reason why it thinks that it was a homicide in occasion of robbery.  

"The house was completely untidy, but the entrances were intact, that is to say that the homicide entered the place with the consent of the victim," said one of the investigators participating in the investigation.  

Justice has already questioned a man who said he was the boyfriend of the transsexual, who clarified that his partner had occasional sexual relations with some regular clients that he had for several months.  

"The transvestite had no newspaper ads or advertisements to work, but had regular clients," said the police chief.  

The lifeless body of Brites was found last Friday at 9:30 pm, in the apartment on the first floor of 125 Rojas street, between Yerbal and Bacacay, a few meters from the Caballito station of the Sarmiento railway.  

The discovery was made by a relative of the victim who went to the missing place because Brites did not answer the phone.  

That person called police station 12 when he saw the door to the Brites department open and saw a large mess inside.  

Detectives located the body in the bedroom, tied hand and foot and dressed only in women's underwear. 

The legal doctors who reviewed the remains determined that the death had occurred about 20 hours earlier, that is, in the early hours of the same Friday between one and two.  

Brites' body had injuries to the skull and face, caused by blows with a blunt object, which would have caused his death.  

Estimates made by the relative who attended the site indicate that at least one mini audio component and a DVD player are missing from the apartment.
