About 4 a.m. of the morning of 3 Dec, 1971, Eric Wade Edmondson, 28, was found lying on their stomach, half on the sidewalk and half in the gutter at 509 Poplar St., Cincinnati, Ohio. They had been shot once in the head.

Edmondson was described by police as a female impersonator and was wearing women's clothing at the time of death.

A man was charged with first degree manslaughter in Edmonson's death, but was cleared at trial on the basis of lack of evidence other than a possibly coerced confession.
