===== Transvestite death case: Saumur freed =====

Raymond Saumur, 24, broke into tears yesterday at his acquittal on a charge of manslaughter in the death of a transvestite.

A Court of Queen's Bench jury deliberated two hours before returning the verdict in the two-day trial before Justice Marcel Nichols.

Saumur had been accused of causing the death of Laureat Garceau, alias Lolo d'Amour, 35, during a quarrel in a Drolet St. parking lot early July 20, 1973.

Evidence showed Saumur discovered Garceau was a male only after the two had engaged in intimate physical contact.

The two then traded punches and Garceau was knocked unconscious when his head struck a parked car.

A pathologist testified Garceau died of a fractured skull. There were no other, marks of violence, evidence showed.

A police ambulance attendant denied a suggestion he had dropped Garceau's body on the pavement while carrying it to the ambulance.
