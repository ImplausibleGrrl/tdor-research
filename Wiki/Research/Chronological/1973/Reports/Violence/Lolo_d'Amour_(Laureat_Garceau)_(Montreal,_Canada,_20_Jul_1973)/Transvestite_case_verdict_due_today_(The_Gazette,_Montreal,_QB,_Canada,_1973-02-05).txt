===== Transvestite case verdict due today =====

A verdict is expected today in the trial of Raymond Saumur, 24, accused of manslaughter in the death of transvestite Laureat Garceau last July 20.

At the end of the first day of trial yesterday, prosecutor Patrick Falardeau declared his case closed after calling eight witnesses. Serge Menard, Saumur's lawyer, said he would present no defence.

Testimony yesterday included that of Gerard Ladouceur, a waiter in a St. Denis St. club, who said he saw Saumur dancing with Garceau, alias Lolo d'Amour, a few hours before Garceau died.
