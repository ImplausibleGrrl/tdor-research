===== Man gives up in death of impersonator =====

A 26-year-old man last night surrendered to police in connection with the death of a 36-year-old professional female impersonator earlier in the day.

Laureat Garceau, who used the stage name of Lola d'Amour in his nightclub appearances, was found unconscious in a parking lot at Drolet and Carmel Sts. He was taken to Hotel Dieu Hospital where he died five hours later.

Police said an autopsy showed Garceau died from a blow to the back of the head.
