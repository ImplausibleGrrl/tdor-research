Early on the morning of July 20th, 1973, Lolo d'Amour, 36, was attacked by Raymond Saumur, 24, in a parking lot near Drolet and Carmel Sts, Montreal, after Saumur discovered Lolo's sex after an evening of dancing and romantic contact.

During the fight, Lolo was knocked unconscious when their head hit a car. They were transported to the Hotel Dieu Hospital where they died five hours later. The cause of death was a fractured skull.

Saumur was cleared by a jury of the charge of manslaughter in a trial on Feb 4th and 5th, 1974.
