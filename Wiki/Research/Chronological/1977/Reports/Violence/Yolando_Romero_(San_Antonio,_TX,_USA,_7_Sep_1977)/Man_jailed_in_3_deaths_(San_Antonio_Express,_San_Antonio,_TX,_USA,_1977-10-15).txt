===== Man jailed in 3 deaths =====
**By PATRICK KEITH**

An accused triple killer was remanded to the Bexar County .Jail without bond Friday night on a third murder charge after a prolonged investigation in which a nickname kept cropping up time after time.

The suspect, himself, was shot by one of his alleged victims and spent two weeks under guard in Bexar County Hospital with a severe chest wound.

The investigation aspect of the cases earned praise from top brass in the homicide division.

Held without bond under orders from Acting Night Magistrate Homer Walls was Joseph Hernandez, 26, of 559 S. San Eduardo Ave. Hernandez also was held simultaneously on bonds of $50,000 each in two other fatal knifings.

Killed were

* Eugenio Perez, 32, of 358 N. San Horacio Ave., kifed to death outside the Culebra Lounge, 2946 Culebra Rd., during an argument last June 11.
* Jimmy Romero, 28, of 227 Chickering Ave, fatally slashed in a fight at the Big Bottle Lounge, 5127 W. Commerce Str. on Sept. 7.
* Gilbert Garcia, 41, of 667 N. San Eduardo Ave., during a brawl in the Culebra Lounge early on the morning of Sept. 30.

==== Notes Compared ====

Homicide Inv. Frank Castillon Jr. filed the charges in two of the cases after he and Det. Charles Butler started comparing notes. The three homicides had been investigated as three separate cases since there was no apparent link among them.

"Charlies and I kept comparing notes on the different cases we were investigating," said Castillon, "and finally it became apparent that some of these cases were almost exactly the same.

"This was especially true in that witnesses used the same nickname for one of the suspects. We just put two and two together."

Hernandez was hospitalized in critical condition Sept. 30 after a brawl in the Culebra Lounge.

When Garcia, serving as acting night manager, went to a table to collect on an overdue beer bill, a fight broke out involving pool sticks, knives and a pistol that Garcia brandished, police said.

Garcia was mortally wounded by knives, but before he fell dying in his own pool of blood he fired three times, hitting two of his assailants.

Two other persons have been charged in the Garcia killing.

==== Impersonator ====

Romero, also known to police as a female impersonator named Yolanda, was stabbed to death during an argument over money. Witnesses gave varying accounts that boiled down to whether Romero was seeking a $5 loan or begging for 25 cents to play the juke box.

Romero was stabbed at least 11 times. Romero — or Yolanda — arrived in the saloon wearing a yellow dress, bra, black panties, girdle and other feminine attire. Identity was established through fingerprints.

Perez' body was found outside the lounge by waitresses going home after the bar closed. There was no sign of a stuggle, police reported at the time. Perez had been stabbed repeatedly over much of his body.

The original charge against Hernandez, brough via a warrant, occured while he was still hospitalized after the Garcia death.

He was transferred to the jail two days agao, and the Romero charge followed. The third charge came Friday night.
