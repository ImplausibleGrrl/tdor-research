NOT ON TDOR LIST

A transvestite identified as Monique was executed with four revolver shots yesterday morning in Cuiabá. Monique, whose [deadname] was Flávio, was murdered while walking near the Sinhá Maria hotel, on the viaduct that gives access to the Imigrantes highway. 

Witnesses told police at the Homicide and Personal Protection Police (DHPP) that Monique left the São Mateus Post in a pickup truck - possibly a Pampa or Saveiro - with a man. The vehicle left towards the center of the capital, exactly on the side of the runway where the body was located. The crime would have occurred around 3 o'clock. One of the suspicions is that Monique was murdered on the spot. "Dragged the transvestite was not because otherwise he would have bruises.
