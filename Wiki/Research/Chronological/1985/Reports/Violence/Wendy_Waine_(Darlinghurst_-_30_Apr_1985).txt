> Prominent Sydney drag queen Wendy Waine was shot execution-style at her home in Kings Cross in 1985. -PR Handout Image
> Authorities are no closer to solving the 1985 murder of a well-known Sydney transgender performer, but investigators believe the killing bore the hallmarks of a professional hit.
> 
> A NSW inquiry into gay hate crimes is on Friday examining the death of Wendy Waine, who was fatally shot in her Darlinghurst apartment in April 1985.
> 
> The inquiry is probing the cold case after the coroner found Ms Waine was killed by an unknown person and Strike Force Parrabell, set up to investigate potential gay-hate deaths, found insufficient information to establish a bias crime.
> 
> Ms Waine's naked body was found next to her bed, with multiple gunshot wounds and bruising to the head consistent with blunt-force trauma, the inquiry was told.
> 
> There was a realistic possibility the performer, a well-known Kings Cross drag queen, was the victim of an LGBTQI-targeted homicide, counsel assisting the inquiry Kathleen Heath said in a submission.
> 
> "However there are other possible reasons why Ms Waine was murdered that are unrelated to LGBTIQ hate," she said.
> 
> The killing had the hallmarks of a professional hit, the inquiry was told, due to the lack of ballistic evidence at the scene, suggesting bullets were removed.
> 
> There was also a "muzzle abrasion" consistent with the use of an automatic pistol.
> 
> Another potential motive for the killing was as retaliation for Ms Waine "flushing" heroin being packaged for sale in the flat by someone else, Ms Heath said.
> 
> An anonymous witness claimed the murder was set up by notorious underworld figure Neddy Smith because Ms Waine "knew too much".
> 
> Someone Ms Waine was in a relationship with could also have been responsible, with the inquiry told several witnesses spoke of her connection to an officer attached to Darlinghurst Police Station.
> 
> "It was no particular secret at the time of Ms Waine's murder that there were rumours circulating that she had been in a relationship with a police officer," Ms Heath said.
> 
> Alternatively, a security guard from MSS Security, potentially in a relationship with Ms Waine, could have been responsible, with a neighbour seeing a security guard entering the building before the killing.
> 
> Ms Waine was last seen with a tattooed young man in a laneway where she would solicit sex work, Ms Heath told the inquiry.
> 
> "Her work as a street-based sex worker exposed her to significant risks of violence generally," she said in her submission.
> 
> Also in the mix was a call made to a Sydney radio station claiming responsibility for the killing on behalf of the "coven of mercy of fate", but Ms Heath labelled that claim as dubious.
> 
> The case involved deficiencies in the police investigation that left loose ends and grounds for serious concern about why lines of inquiry were not pursued, she said.
> 
> "Regrettably today we are no closer to knowing the identity of Ms Waine's killer or potentially killers," Ms Heath said, adding a "multitude of theories" remained.
