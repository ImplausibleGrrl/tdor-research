[According to their mother Traylon IDed as a cisgender gay man]


> In October, 29-year-old Brittany White was found fatally shot in a parked vehicle in the 7100 block of Gayglen Drive in southeast Dallas.
> Police said two of the victims had gotten into a car with someone, and the third had let someone into her car. Also, police said two of the women had been near Spring Avenue and Lagow Street just before the attacks.
> 
> White's mother, Terry Brown, thinks that she knows who killed her child and that the motive was robbery, not hate.
> 
> Although police described White as a transgender woman, Brown said her child identified as Traylon Brown, a gay man who wore wigs and dresses when he went out with men.
> Police also have said they were looking into potential ties among the attacks and an unexplained death reported in 2017, in which a transgender woman's body was found in a field in the 2900 block of Wilhurt Avenue in east Oak Cliff.
> 
> In May 2018, a transgender woman was found dead in White Rock Creek. That death was eventually ruled a suicide, according to Dallas County medical examiner's records.


> Oct. 21, 2018: 29-year-old Traylon Brown, a gay cisgender man who also identified as Brittany White was found “deceased inside his vehicle from homicidal violence” on Oct. 21, 2018, at 7100 Gayglen Drive, Dallas Texas.


> October 21, 2018, 29-year-old Brittany White was found shot to death in a vehicle parked near an elementary school in far southeastern Dallas, police said.
