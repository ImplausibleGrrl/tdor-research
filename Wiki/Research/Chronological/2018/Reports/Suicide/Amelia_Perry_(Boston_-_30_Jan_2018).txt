Today I woke up in tears for no reason, but I knew the reason.

The passage of time, 2 years today, hasn’t made 
@kepsega
’s death any easier to take.


Last night I read the poem I wrote in her memory at the Berkeley Poetry Slam. The emotions of the moment I wrote it are all still there, still fresh long after.

We still don’t take mental health and transgender care seriously in this country. Nothing has been learned.

I still wear one of hir “Make Math Gay” pins every day, and often have to explain.

She could have made a bunch as a quant but planned to go to the Broad Institute, because saving lives was an ethical use of her training, whereas making money was not.

It’s also why I’ve been very careful to have plans the last few and the next few days. I need to stay in the present! Someday I hope this gets easier, but honestly zie deserves to be remembered, and cried over.)

mental health treatment is so primitive. for physical pain, there's morphine. here there's no escalation path for pain except suicide

MH differs from physical in placing 90% of the recovery work on the pt, as well as the lack of painkillers / anesthetic

suicide is an escalation path for pain, and treatment here offers me no other escalation paths, so what do I do right now except kill myself

Here’s why psychiatric hospitals are so bad at helping transgender patients
One of America's most at-risk populations frequently gets incompetent and unwelcoming care at psychiatric facilities.

Lying in a psychosis ward bed, Amelia Perry couldn’t shake thoughts of suicide. The noise blaring from other patients in the hallway and the bright lights above felt like too much. Perry, a 25-year-old trans person, was in the hospital seeking help.

Days earlier, Perry (who asked at admission to be identified by gender-neutral pronouns ze and hir) had been discharged from another nearby hospital following a week-long stay after attempting suicide. That’s how Perry ended up in the noisy psychosis ward at McLean Hospital, a Boston-area psychiatric hospital.

A clinician allegedly said Perry couldn’t be in a room with two beds in the Proctor House ward, which treats patients for dissociative disorders and trauma, and that there were no single-bed rooms available. Perry, who had asked to be placed in a women’s shared room, was instead placed in a single-bed room at a different McLean unit — North Belknap, which treats patients with OCD and psychotic disorders.

It sounded like gender discrimination, Perry said at the time. According to nursing notes obtained by ThinkProgress, hospital staff placed Perry in the psych unit due to clinical acuity — pulling out hair and head-banging.

But “the psychosis ward is harmful and triggering to me,” Perry told ThinkProgress in an interview at the time. “I am not psychotic.”

“Maybe when society is more progressive,” the clinician allegedly said, would Perry get the right bed in the right ward.

When asked about Perry’s case, McLean Hospital spokesperson Adriana Bobinchock said that since 2011, the hospital has developed policies and training to “reinforce a culture of acceptance and tolerance.” Among the hospital’s current policies, Bobinchock said, is a patient’s “right to be placed in a room with a roommate without regard to the patient’s gender identity, [but that] certain patients, regardless of gender identity or any other protected class factor, may be better cared for in a single room.” Bobinchock added that if a patient feels a policy had been violated, they should contact the hospital’s own “patient civil rights office,” and the hospital could investigate.

Perry did file a civil rights complaint with McLean Hospital’s civil rights office and went on a hunger strike, demanding a bed at Proctor House. Still on hunger strike, Perry was discharged and moved to another emergency room in Cambridge, Mass., and offered a placement in a facility north of Boston. Perry’s psychiatrist warned that not taking that available bed could make it harder to get into any in-patient placement from this emergency room visit. But friends had told Perry this hospital was a bad place for transgender patients, and Perry went home instead.

Finally, after about 91 hours without food, Perry got a bed at Proctor House.

ThinkProgress interviewed Perry on several occasions during and after the hunger strike. Ze made progress, but couldn’t get past the thoughts of suicide. Over the next couple months, Perry wrote on Facebook about going in and out of the hospital without finding the right mix of medications and assistance.

“I attempted suicide again in late December and spent new year’s in an abusive inpatient unit,” Perry wrote on Facebook on January 22. “I don’t have any motivation to continue; a small part of me feels obliged to stick around to try a couple more treatment options (TCAs, ketamine, maybe ECT). We’ll see…”

Amelia Perry died on January 30.

Perry’s experience with mental health care was disturbing, but not an anomaly: the estimated 1.4 million-plus Americans who identify as transgender and/or gender non-conforming struggle with mental health at much higher rates than their cisgender peers. Trans Lifeline and the National LGBTQ Task Force surveyed 8,574 people in 2017, almost all of whom self-identify as transgender and are U.S. citizens. Eighty-eight percent said they have considered ending their own life. Over half have attempted suicide at one point. Those suicide attempt rates are far above the national averages for people of all genders (about 0.5 percent of adults).

But with overtaxed psychiatric care facilities that frequently lack the training and expertise to competently treat transgender patients, the American health-care system frequently fails those who need psychiatric hospitalization.
