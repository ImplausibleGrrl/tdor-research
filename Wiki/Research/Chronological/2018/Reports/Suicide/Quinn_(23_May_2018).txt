> Today marks 2 years since I found out about my friend Quinn’s Suicide. 
> 
> As I delve into that grief this year I get to look back at all the amazing progress I’ve made myself as a Mortuary student and Advocate. 
> I started @transdeathcare  in September out of this experience 2 years ago that took away a loved and honoured friend to their Creator, while giving me a truer sense of my own mortality as a Trans person. 
> 
> So this year there gets to be a little bit of happy alongside this horrible reminder of grief, serving as a reminder that at some point that grief can truly be divested into something healing. 
> I miss you Quinn and I know others do too.
