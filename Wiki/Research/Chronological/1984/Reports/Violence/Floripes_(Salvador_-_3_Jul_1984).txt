The story of Floripes, Salvador's first transvestite, brutally killed

Floripes had the intelligence acquired in the struggle for survival. If the provocation, for the slightest slip, slipped into offense, there was no conversation, it was rain of fist right there.  

A striking figure in the imaginary of downtown Salvador, for more than a decade, he was seen parading on Rua Chile, Barroquinha and Baixa dos Sapateiros. She was also a regular at parties in the square and did not miss a single Bonfim, Iemanjá or Santa Bárbara. He wore a rue branch behind his ear, bouncing between the abundant hair loose in the wind. Beads hung around the neck of the orixás.

“He was a black man, carrying candomblé symbols and, surely, the first transvestite in town. And although he carried marks stigmatized by society, he never remained silent or accepted submission. Floripes walked around the visibility spaces to say: 'I exist. And I can and deserve to be here. 'This is its importance, ”says Adson Brito, a history professor and psychologist, who keeps a group on Facebook (“ Salvador has many stories! ”) About events and important personalities in our capital.

Pouting
The arrival of Floripes always precipitated a unique event, overcoming the boredom of routine tasks. The distinguished Salvadoran ladies pouted, while the more radical crossed the street lightly to demonstrate a superior pleasure in not allowing the same sidewalk to be divided. 

Little boys raised in upscale neighborhoods blushed and “serious businessmen” babbled (without daring to raise the tone) offenses directed at their honor.  

Floripes shrugged his shoulders at that festival of contempt and hostilities, being welcomed and celebrated among the commoners. On each corner, she was greeted by a chorus of “Floripeeeees, fagot” - something, today, that would sound extremely homophobic.

At the time, however, it was a kind of greeting, a cordiality answered with calculated mannerisms. Floripes put his hand on his waist, accentuated the sway and let out his low voice, making his staff reverberate: “only in Bahiaaaaaa”. The applause confirmed the success of the number.

In a short time, he started to answer for a new nickname, indicative of his solar and overflowing figure: “A Alegria da Cidade”.

His predilection for colorful clothes reinforced this luminous personality, as well as the resourcefulness in acrobatic dances and juggles that are difficult to perform. During the parties, there was always a moment for free expression of the body, standing out in the crowd for its swing and elasticity.

When one more fellow, however, borrowed some daring not granted, time closed. Floripes rolled up his sleeves and set off for the physical confrontation, forcing the loose between slaps and kicks.

 “This was the way that Floripes had to become respected. In the 1970s and 1980s, homophobia was even worse than it is today. It was not even a crime and this type of prejudice was legitimized in society. She might not have all the words to explain that she deserved respect. His way of reacting was this, on the basis of the violence of the oppressed. But this shows that Floripes did not accept to be subdued. That was his resistance ”, analyzes Brito.

Life, death and forgetfulness
Although famous throughout Salvador, much information about Floripes is completely unknown and, therefore, permeated by doubts and mysteries. What little is known is that he was born under the name of Benito Matos and, before the transformation, he worked as a cook in popular restaurants, having also occupied functions as a washer and ironer for men's clothes.

Data on a possible marriage, the place where he was born and the whereabouts of his parents and siblings fell into complete oblivion.

The circumstances of his death are also hazy. The most widespread among the versions is that she was murdered by a handyman at the São Miguel market, in Baixa dos Sapateiros, on July 3, 1984. In the story that became public, Floripes would have played with the man and stolen a piece of the meat of your plate, in a seductive onslaught.

Irritated, the guy threw a series of punches and killed Floripes right there, in the middle of the day. Hours later, questioned by a police inspector, he reportedly said that he “knew Floripes and had nothing against her”, but that “her joy irritated”.

Floripes' second death was his almost complete erasure from history. For a personality that marked the collective imagination of an entire generation of Salvadorans, there are very few citations in newspapers, academic papers or simple mentions on the internet. A silence that does not match with such an eloquent existence.

“Rescuing Floripes' story and telling her who she was was a service that we provide to her memory. Before all the struggles against homophobia, before theories and works of tolerance, there was someone here who resisted prejudice alone and used his courage for a single right: that of simply existing. Floripes is the joy of this city ”, concludes Adson.
