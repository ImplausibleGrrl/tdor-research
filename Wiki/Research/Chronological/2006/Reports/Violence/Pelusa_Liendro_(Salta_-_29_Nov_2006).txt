> SALTA (Writing Critical Voices). Today in the afternoon they will commemorate the 15th anniversary of the crime of " Pelusa" Liendro . The memory of the first trans woman who organized a march for sexual diversity in Salta will be one of the reasons for today's LGBT Pride demonstration.
> 
> 15 years have passed since the death of "Pelusa" Liendro and his relatives continue to demand justice. The causes that led to his death are not completely clarified, his loved ones suspect that the condemned are not the true responsible for his death.
> 
> She was a true reference of the LGBT movement in the province  and that is why today at the march they will say a few words about her life. On the other hand, one of her friends, Rosario Sansone, had been identified as the main suspect in the crime but was later acquitted.
> 
> Today in the morning the sister of "Pelusa" Liendro, Rosalinda Liendro, communicated to the media her family's request. "We wanted the guilty prisoners. There are two people imprisoned with life imprisonment for the crime of Pelusa , but as Rosario (friend of the victim) told what happened to her that she was about to sign that she was the guilty of the crime ..." , he began by saying about the first suspect.
> 
> The detainees
> 
> He then continued about the men who were arrested for her death: “They were in a cyber shop and the police came and told them that they were responsible for Pelusa's crime. At the trial these two boys never confessed or spoke. I believe, like Rosario, that my sister was killed by the Salta police because everything coincides, everything happened in November 2006: the video against the police, the march through the red zone, the pressures. So today I still have serious doubts if they are guilty or are parsley, "he said.

> In a few months it will be 12 years since the murder of “Pelusa” Liendro, a resounding case of violence against transgender people that hit the Police. The family still awaits the 120 thousand pesos for lost earnings after the 2009 ruling. (Luz Ruíz Zintak)
> In the Miguel Ángel de la Cerda passageway at 11 pm on November 29, 2006, they found the dying body of “Pelusa” Liendro, who was one of the first trans prostitutes to lead a constant struggle to organize and promote the creation of a red zone and thus avoid the dangers of the street and the sex market. Fighting that battle reached the twilight of his life.
> 
> On the night of November 29, Liendro (41 years old) was in her car accompanied by two men (Silvio Elías Soria and Sergio Alfredo Núñez), who were later sentenced to life imprisonment by the Justice, found guilty of ending their lives. of Fluff after stabbing her seven times; the lethal stab was the one that went to one of the lungs, piercing it and thus causing a hemorrhage; the 41-year-old trans whore died of two cardiac arrests at the San Bernardo Hospital.
> 
> Pelusa was the second sister of seven, she was always reserved in terms of her personal life since she did not want to worry any family member. She was one of the first trans prostitutes to bring the gay pride march to Salta capital, she had an arduous and constant fight with the members of the police institution due to the constant abuses of power. One of the objectives of their fight was to request a controlled red zone near the Martearena stadium, a health card for all sex workers and the most important: that the police repression that the girls of the night have always suffered end.
> 
> A week before her murder, Pelusa, through a hidden camera, exposed how the police violently repressed her companions. In another segment of the film it is clearly seen how she opens her purse to pay a bribe. This program was broadcast by “La otra campana”.
> 
> “ My sister was reluctant because she realized that she was playing with people of political power, but when she thought about what she was doing it was too late. Despite the results of the trial, we believe that the Police are involved in his death, it always seemed strange to me that the Government that was in office at the time (Juan Romero) offered a reward of $ 50,000 for anyone who could provide relevant information or data ", Rosalina, his sister, tells us, who also defined the trial that took place three years after his murder as "confusing and unsatisfactory" since at the time it took place, there were around three versions about what happened the night of the whore's death.
> 
> The first indicated the accused Silvio Elías Soria as Liendro's murderer out of “jealousy”, since “Pelusa” was looking at his partner a lot. In the second hypothesis, it is said that the victim had HIV, however, when the autopsy was performed, the results came out negative; A third hypothesis is based on the fact that Soria, after the fact, said that he spoke with Fernando Pequeno, Miguel Ragone's grandson, and told him that it was the police who forced him to say the version that revolves around jealousy.
> 
> Of these three versions, none could be confirmed at trial. The knife that the attacker used as the only knife was not recognized by the defendants or by the coroner, the only thing that could be proven was that there were two people inside the car.
> 
> The First Criminal Chamber sentenced Silvio Elías Soria and Sergio Alfredo Núñez to life imprisonment on December 7, 2009 for being responsible for the crime of qualified homicide for treachery to the detriment of Pelusa Liendro. The Court, which was made up of the Chamber Judges, Abel Fleming, Carlos Nieva and Adolfo Figueroa, also partially gave rise to the claim for compensation for pecuniary damage against Soria and Núñez, condemning them to pay the sum of 120 thousand pesos for lost profits. This amount of money never reached the hands of the Liendro family.
> 
> As for the lawyer Santiago Pedroza, defender of Soria, in the trial he admitted his client's drug addiction, he also told the judges that Soria had been "seduced" by "Pelusa" at the age of 14. Rosalina tells Cuarto Poder that Pedroza himself, before presenting the murderer's defense, appeared at the wake to offer his condolences to the victim's family and friends, “he offered us his free legal services, but since my father already had a lawyer friend who was going to defend the case, we had to reject it. On the day of the trial, we were surprised that Pedroza was defending my sister's murderer ”.
> 
> Rosalina Liendro left as a final reflection the following: “As a family we are left with the distaste of justice, full of doubts and with the assurance that the real culprits are still free. Nothing and no one is going to return Pelusa to us, we live each day with a lot of pain and absence and for having seen the tragic and bloody way with which they ended his life. Pelusa's fight against police repression and in favor of a controlled red zone was what sadly killed her. I would like his fight to continue and to be achieved for what he fought so hard and cost him his life ”.

> Rosario is anxiously waiting in a corner of "the zone." Unlike other nights, no patrolman harasses her. A cool calm brushes her skin. A car stops and she rushes in. He greets Lint like every night for several years. Tonight Fluff is quiet, nervous and staring. He drives silently into a dark passage, parks, and they look at each other. "Rosario, we are very played." Suddenly it starts to rain, huge drops break through the foliage of an old mulberry tree and smear the windshield of the car. Fluff drops a dark tear, a mixture of mascara and terror. "They're not going to do anything to us, friend," Rosario replies as she searches her purse for a handkerchief all wrung out with which Pelusa wipes her tears. The rain begins to flood the tangled passageways of Barrio San Antonio,
> 
> That car was always a refuge. Years ago they met one freezing night in which Pelusa parked in front of Rosario and invited her to come in for a while to get out of the cold. At that time they worked near the old terminal and sometimes in the park. Sharing "the area" was making them accomplices. Every time their faces lit up with the red and blue of the patrol cars, they got in the car and faced whatever came their way together.After each police run, Rosario and Pelusa, sitting in that car, chatted and thought together how to make the violence stop. Both had lived in the Capital and knew other provinces, they knew that in some places the transvestites had conquered a red zone, even managed to have the offense codes repealed. Every time they finished the night and sat down to chat, they fantasized together about putting a stop to everything, about stopping having to lend the body to the jute, about stopping spending nights piled high in a damp police station.
> 
> One night Rosario gets into the car broken with rage. "They killed Tatiana, Pelu." "Which Tatiana? La Ortiz? ”. Rosario nods, she is devastated. Fluff starts the car at full speed and grabs an old dirt road behind the hospital. "This can not go on like this. They're going to fill that morgue with the bodies of our friends. We have to do something Rosario, otherwise one day they will kill us all ". The two look at each other. They have to hug each other very tightly so that their bodies stop shaking, in the distance they see the lights of a patrol car, but nothing matters. They hug in the car like two girls under the bed waiting for a storm to end. They feel it approaching them, raising dust, and their noses fill with the smell of earth. They are so hugged that they can only hear each other's pulse racing. When they open their eyes they are alone and safe. It was that night that they understood that as long as they were together they were immune to fear.
> 
> 
> Pelusa and Rosario organized a march. The first Gay Pride March in Salta. He called himself gay more out of habit than because of his makeup. Most of the marchers were transvestites. Transvestites and sex workers. They had already been dead for several, many beaten, too many nights behind bars. They needed to stop the police and end the codes and the bribes. The march went through the city like an open wound, from “the zone” to the police station and the legislature. For three years they marched, went on TV, gave interviews and reported to the police. Year after year, Rosario and Pelusa were photographed together, stupendous and fiery as Thelma and Louise.
> 
> November nights in Salta are rainy. The storm spreads over the Lerma Valley and floods the suburbs. "The zone" was always on the margins of the city, near the old channel of the Arenales River, that is why it is also known as "the lower one". During the rainy months you have to be careful. That night Pelusa and Rosario spoke on the phone. The storm did not stop. "Are we going to go to work, Rosi?" ... "You're crazy! Not with this rain ”answered Rosario. Pelusa insisted: "But yes, stop?" "Yes, stop, yes." "Ready, see you in the area, Ro." Then Rosario receives a call from a certain Ricardo or Roberto. They knew each other from "the area", the guy had seen her all produced and goddess, with those deadly curves and her shiny brown hair. She did not give to meet him while at home, coquetry can more than need. On top of that, it rains and Rosario doesn't feel like going out. Customers can wait, he thinks.
> 
> A year later, Rosario sitting in an ATTTA office remembers with her voice choked with tears: “ My friend also receives a call and she does go. In five minutes they find her with seven stab wounds . In the street, dying. What those who helped her told the judge was that all she asked of my friend was that they not let her die. But for me, my friend said everything that happened, but the police are there. The same police who we took a hidden camera ten days before showing how they bribed us and how they beat transvestites to detain them ”.
> 
> Fifteen years have passed since the last hug. A little of Rosario went with Pelusa and a little of Pelusa stayed with Rosario. Transvestite friendships have that border between life and death. We remember ourselves to remember those fragments of who we are and that are buried in the memory of those who left us. We make roots to bury ourselves a little with our friends, storms to extinguish the penalties and files to bear witness to those hugs in which we protect ourselves.

> Upon hearing screams, the neighbors alerted the police officers and paramedics, who were present at the scene. In this way, Liendro was transferred to the San Bernardo hospital, where he died a few minutes later while being treated for the injuries he received.
> Liendro worked with the lawyer Santiago Pedroza in the elaboration of a project that was going to be presented on Tuesday in the provincial Chamber of Deputies. "Pelusa was drawing up plans for the area and the initiative included the modification of the Law on Police Contraventions, " described the lawyer, who was surprised to learn of the murder of the transvestite, whom he defined as a "correct and educated" person .
