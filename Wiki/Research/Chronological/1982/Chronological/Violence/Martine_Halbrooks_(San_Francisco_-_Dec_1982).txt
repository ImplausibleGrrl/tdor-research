> My trans sister fled Alabama. Now she’s dead; don’t let history repeat
> Martine Halbrooks
> Martine boarded a bus in 1982 to find a more welcoming life as a trans woman elsewhere. She never returned.
> 
> Alabama. On Dad’s side, our roots go deep in the Deep South, deep as the roots of the mulberry tree I’d climb as a child to write in my journal, deep as the waters of Logan Martin Lake, by the Coosa River, where Granny and Pappy built their dream home, deep as the girlhood friendships I formed on our street of split-level suburbia.
> 
> Fifty years ago, on July 26, 1972, my oldest sibling packed a green duffel bag, placed an envelope on the kitchen counter in the semi-darkness of dawn and slipped out of our house at 606 Hillmont Street in Huntsville, Alabama.
> 
> She had turned 19 the week before. I had just turned 13. I was sleeping upstairs, as were Mom and Dad and David, who was eight. Bobby, at 18, had already left for the Air Force. I imagine our brown dachshund yawned and shifted as Martine opened the front door and bounded down the front steps, passing my mulberry tree.
> 
> Martine would have turned left, her back to the hill of Hillmont Street, her back to the dead end of Hillmont Street, and walked down to the road below. Her thumb was her mode of transport.
> 
> She left behind a note on typewriter paper, now yellowed and crisp. I keep it on my desk in the sunroom. In her note, which is profound and brilliant and expansive and detailed, she writes, “Someone asked me if I was trying to find myself. I said I know myself well enough. I am looking for a place for myself. Huntsville is not the place, nor Birmingham, nor Tuscaloosa.”
> 
> Not Huntsville, where we grew up, nor Birmingham, where our grandparents lived, nor Tuscaloosa, where Martine first went out on her own. Alabama was not the place. Alabama, where it was illegal to cohabitate in 1971. Alabama, where it was a crime to be gay. Alabama, where the Civil War was only four generations removed, our great-great-grandfather a Confederate cavalry soldier who played the bugle and died at Camp Chase as a prisoner of war. Alabama, where Mom forbade Martine from inviting Black friends into our home on Hillmont Street. No, Alabama was not the place for Martine.
> 
> She headed west to San Francisco. It was not the first time, nor the last. She had been at least once during the spring semester of the one year that she was a student at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa. For the next ten years, she’d return briefly to visit family and friends, then leave again, looking for a place in the city of the Golden Gate
> 
> On June 2, 1982, Granny took Martine to the bus station for her last trip across the country. Martine had told Mom that there were “people in San Francisco who could help.” Granny snapped a photo of Martine standing in front of the door of the Greyhound bus in Tuscaloosa, lips pressed together in a calm smile, long blonde hair, fair skin, a denim shirt. She gazed into the camera lens, which is to say, she looked into Granny’s eyes. And click! In an instant, the last photo we would ever have of Martine was captured on film. Granny developed that film and printed copies for each of us remaining siblings.
> 
> In 1982, I did not know to call the person in that picture by her name. I did not know to call her “sister,” or to use “she.” I would learn later that while living in San Francisco, she changed her name to Martine, wore dresses, and sought gender-affirming care. I would learn later that she’d told Mom that she was a girl.
> 
> Martine left Alabama because there was little help for her in 1972, or even in 1982. There are more resources in Alabama now than there were 50 or 40 years ago, but the resources themselves have been outlawed. The resources Martine needed then, the resources young people need now, have been criminalized.
> 
> The state of Alabama has made it a felony to provide gender-affirming care to a young person, punishable by ten years in prison and a $15,000 fine. Only a temporary injunction is currently preventing enforcement of this law. But Alabama’s attorney general Steve Marshall is using language from Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the ruling that overturnedRoe v. Wade, to argue that the injunction cannot remain, and that the state should be able to prosecute parents and helpers who provide access and resources for gender-affirming care.
> 
> Martine went looking for helpers. Today, in Alabama, the helpers are labeled as felons. Felons lose their right to be members of certain professional associations. Felons lose their right to vote. Alabama is criminalizing its helpers, threatening accepting, loving parents with prison time and forcing young people, like Martine, on a perilous journey across state lines.
> 
> In 1982, Martine would reach San Francisco and rent a room on Minna Street at a Single Room Occupancy hotel in the Tenderloin district, room #303, where, six months later, her body would be found. The police did not investigate; they didn’t even open a case. Last year, the deadliest year ever for transgender people in the United States, a career detective reviewed the police report and autopsy and said Martine’s death should have been investigated as a homicide. Forty years later, life continues to be dangerous for transgender people everywhere, even in cities we think of as welcoming.
> 
> In San Francisco, there is gender affirming care. It is not illegal, it is not new, but how can it be accessible when there is no affordable place to live? Alabama would not be the place for Martine today, neither would San Francisco. There are no rooms for her to rent. Inflation is rising now, just as it was back then. A housing crisis hits hard for those who have historically faced employment discrimination and housing discrimination.
> 
> Alabama is no sweet home.
> 
> Rev. Brenda Walker
> The author: Rev. Brenda Walker
> 
> Governor Kay Ivey used transgender children as props in her re-election campaign, as evidence to counter her primary opponent’s claims she was “a Democrat in Republican clothing.” She signed bills targeting transgender children, as she tweeted, “...We’re going to go by how God made us: If the Good Lord made you a boy, you’re a boy, and if he made you a girl, you’re a girl. It’s simple.” I’ve been an ordained pastor since 1983 and served churches for more than forty years, since my young adult years in Alabama, and I can tell you that her simplistic view of gender and scripture is wrong.
> 
> I’m not the only pastor who understands this. The one named plaintiff in the lawsuit that led to the temporary injunction is a pastor. The parents who filed the lawsuit remain anonymous for their own protection because Alabama law considers them felons, along with the healthcare providers for their children. The courageous Alabama pastor who attached his name to the lawsuit at significant risk to himself is Reverend Paul A. Eknes-Tucker.
> 
> A few weeks later, Reverend Eknes-Tucker joined with clergy across Alabama in signing a letter of support for transgender people and their families. Fifty years after Martine left Alabama behind, looking for her place, more than eighty clergy and church staff from Huntsville, Birmingham, Tuscaloosa and elsewhere, are providing strong and vocal support for transgender youth. Amidst the threat of a jail sentence, the pastors issued sentences of care and love and compassion. These are friends, not felons. Their voices are music in the midst of hatred’s tinny sound, its harsh, brash words, threats of jail time and felony charges.
> 
> Laws can be cruel, unjust and passed in order to spread fear and create scapegoats, scaring up a base of angry voters, united against a common enemy. Except their enemy is my family. Their enemy is my friend. They are staring down our precious, most vulnerable children, with slanderous misinformation.
> 
> We harden our own hearts with these laws and our silence and inaction. We look away, think: it’s not my place to say something. We create unjust and unnecessary suffering, and hurt ourselves as we become people of the lie, propping up the big lie with hollow hearts and cruel decisions.
> 
> It need not be so. There is another voice, the voice of love and it is the sweetness of Alabama.
> 
> Rev. Brenda Walker is a retired Presbyterian pastor and an advocate for transgendered people and their loved ones.
