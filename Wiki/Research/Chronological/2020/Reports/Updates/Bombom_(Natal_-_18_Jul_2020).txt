The only reports I can find around this date in Natal seem to relate to this case:

> A 27-year-old man was shot dead on Friday night (17) in the Quintas neighborhood, in the West Zone of Natal. Marcos Vinícius Honório de Oliveira was shot in the chest and head and died on the spot.
> 
> The crime happened between the streets Raimundo França, in which Marcos Vinícius lived, and Creso Bezerra. He was called by two men to the section where the roads cross. Once there, he was murdered. According to the Military Police, the boy was shot with at least three shots.
> 
> None of the 27-year-old's belongings was stolen in the crime and so the Military Police believe it is an execution. Marcos Vinícius wore an anklet and had already been arrested for assault and drug trafficking.
