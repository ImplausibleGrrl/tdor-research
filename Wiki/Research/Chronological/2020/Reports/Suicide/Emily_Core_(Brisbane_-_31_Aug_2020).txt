suicide

On 7 September on the Facebook Group "transgender SRS" a user reported the suicide of an Iranian transgender girl, but resident in the USA, with the name Emily Core. On her instagram profile there are messages from her family confirming the news.


Hi Facebook friends . Please give me a little time today and read this topic . There is something very important that I want to discuss with you in this topic . 

As many of you know I had a terrible face feminising surgery last year with dr jesus baez marquez. 

He kept me 15 hours in the operating room just for forehead and nose surgery (I guess he could not finish the surgery nad he had to get some help from other surgeons outside) . 

I had serious isde effects after the surgery (I had infection and I was almost blind for 2 months . in Those two months I could not work . I could not even go for shopping . Once I went to the doctor and I could not find Uber because I could not see the plate number)

The saddest part of this story was the surgery result . The more that I waited for the final result , the more my face looked unusall . 

There was a hole in the middle of the forehead with sharp angles on eyebrows , deeper set eyes and too much inconsistency between left and right . There was a very bad scare under my nose (it is still clear adter one year)

I went to many FFS surgeons to ask for revision so I look like human again . All of them rejected me because the damage on the bones structure were not fixable . 

I am not writing this topic to explain what happened to me . I am writing to explain the irresponsibility of transgenders community to each other. This surgeon is being advertised by admins and some other paid members inside Facebook FFS groups 

I tried to write about my experience in any place that transgenders may look for information about surgeries because and I was blocked from all of them because trans admins are paid by surgeons.
1- There are two FFS facebook groups  and admins blocked me and they removed all my comments that I explained about my surgery 
2- I wrote  in reddit and they also removed the topic 
3-I wrote in susans place and they blocked me and removed the topic . 

If anybody wants to get information about surgeons, there are just false reviews from paid people. There is no real information about them in transgenders surgery groups 
Unfortualy there is a mafia behind transgenders surgeries and transgenders sell each with a very low price . They don't care about each other. They are just working for whoever pay them. 

I wrote this topic in any  Facebook groups  and  I was removed immediately  . I have added my real photo(without makeup and filter here) there is also the ,ct scan of my head and some emails from other surgeons in response to my surgery requests . 

This is  my real photo . As you can see there is a nice whole in the middle of forehead  and sharp angles on eye brows . Inconsistency is obvious.
As you can see in the ct scan frontal sinus bones is not attached to any place . it is just free on the air . it has a negative angle with nose  that it has never seen in any human being anatomy . 

Facial team have being fixed many botched surgeries  . As you can see in their email I am not fixable anymore . I need to live with the terrible face that Baez made for me for the rest of my life.

I asked many other well known ffs surgeons if revision is possible but I got the same answer

Yesterday was "are you ok" day and unfortunately I have realized one of my Facebook friends who was belonging to LGBT community suicided in Brisbane and the Police found her body 9 days ago in her unit...This is shocking, devastating and extremely upsetting ...based on her posts she was under male to female transformation operation and unfortunately unlike a lot of costs and energy spent during that process, the surgery was failed with a lot issues and inconsistencies in her face and one of the bones. She went to the different doctors and plastic surgeons but all of them confirmed that cannot get fixed. She was discriminated in some job interviews and bullied at work and sadly she decided to finish her life I guess two weeks ago... "are you ok" day is not just one day...Every day should be "are you ok day" we should encourage this culture more as if she was not left alone (in regardless of her being belonging to the minority group) she would have stayed alive between us....we also killed her by our ignorance ....God Bless Her ....RIP Emily Core
