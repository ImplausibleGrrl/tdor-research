Sad, from what I saw she was from Manaus and was in SP, imagine the scare that the family will take with this news ðŸ˜­ DEP

Guys, was it really suicide?

Because I was looking at her face and she posted a video of someone making threats. Was it not murder and they made it look like suicide?

She was my sister's friend / client. I told her and she thought the same thing.

Because she said she saw her 5 days ago, she was great because she had just had her chest done and had some aesthetic procedures... she was going to compete in miss trans and was at her peak.

And it was from the drool, neh, he was a wonderful person, but he made the runners. So it gets hard to know
