suicide

A trans was found hanged with a rope in a paradise of her home

Silvana Roldán was 35 years old and lived with her relatives in a humble house in the John Kennedy neighborhood. She was found dead on her property by a close friend. The Prosecutor's Office ordered the autopsy.

It was a few minutes before nine in the morning yesterday, when a relative of the young trans got up to go to work. She was at her house, which is located on Calle 234 in the aforementioned neighborhood. Looking towards the patio of her house, she discovered that "something hung from a paradise". She went to see what it was and confirmed that it was Roldán.

Immediately, she alerted the members of the Community Police Station 10 to the unfortunate fact.
The uniformed men were present at the Roldán family home. They found the trans hanged with a rope, from the plant found in the patio of his home.
"Sil" as her loved ones affectionately called her, was a happy and very active person among her companions. The reasons that led to her drastic determination to end her life are unknown. She would have hanged herself in the early hours of yesterday.
The body of the victim was examined by the Police Health doctor, who indicated that he had been dead for several hours. So he advised that he be subjected to an autopsy, in order to establish, reliably, the time of his death and the details of his death.
By order of the Capital Prosecutor's Office, the experts of the Scientific Police Division carried out the work of photographs and planimetries on the victim's property, from where they kidnapped various elements in order to discover the reasons that led to the determination to end your life.

Suicide from his brother
While Silvana's family members were shocked by the inexplicable decision he had made, a "wound from the past began to bleed" between them. A couple of years ago, a relative of the young trans had been found hanged.
It is her older brother, who had depression problems and could not cope with the situation, despite the help of her relatives. Submerged in sadness, he hanged himself in the courtyard of the property. At that time, he was found by a friend. The family was devastated by the situation they had to live in the face of the tragic event.

"You will always be in our memories"

Silvana was a well-known hairdresser from the John Kennedy neighborhood. After the tragic death that was known yesterday morning, her friends and family began to fire her through social networks.
"Rest in peace Silvana, you will always be in our memory," wrote a friend of the young trans. While a close friend posted on her Facebook account: “My God, my friend. You were the joy of the party. May the light that has no end shine for her. ”
For their part, the victim's relatives gave her the last goodbye, saying: “Friend and sister, we are going to miss you. We do not understand the decision you made friend. Fly high, see you soon. ”
Friends and family multiplied messages of encouragement for those close to them in a matter of minutes in the face of Silvana's irreparable loss.

> 13/07/2020, we received the sad news that the companion #Silvana Silvana Roldan, 35, who was located in the city of Santiago del Estero (Prov de Santiago del Estero), took her own life.
>
> It's the third suicide death in less than a month, this year they have grown significantly due to lack of public policies including Trans People, it's really unfortunate that three deaths are due to this, and none of them were older than 35.
>
> We need answers from the STATE, we no longer want companions killed by depression, it is a very high index disease in the Trans Argentina population, this is only due to lack of empathy, and quit.
>
> RIP BEAUTIFUL.
