> Charlie's mother told the M.E.N that she was told her son was being checked on once every five minutes at the time he was fatally injured. She believes he should not have been left alone at all at the time.
> 
> He had previously had one-to-one monitoring because of his history of self-harm and attempts on his own life, the review says.
> 
> It reveals that at the time he was found unresponsive he had only been back at the unit for two-and-a-half hours, after having been on home leave.
> 
> An inquest was due to open on February 28 into Charlie's death but it has now been adjourned by the Coroner to a later date in view of the external report.

> Rowan Thompson (Image: MEN Media)
> The M.E.N has seen a draft copy of a Serious Incident Review done by the Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust following the death of Rowan Thompson, who died weeks before Charlie.
> 
> At Prestwich he had observations every 15 minutes because of concerns about self-harm.
> 
> The review, a copy of which was sent to Rowan Thompson's father, said 'there were shortfalls in how the observations were carried out' on the day of his death. However it added that 'there was also evidence of good practice when a random audit of CCTV footage was carried out.'
> 
> The review describes how Rowan, who was being treated at Prestwich's Gardener Unit after being sectioned under the Mental Health Act, had undergone blood tests after experiencing weight loss.
> 
> The sample was processed the day before he died at a laboratory at Salford Royal Hospital and it indicated that he had 'very low' levels of potassium. But the lab was unable to reach anyone at Prestwich Hospital to alert them, despite trying several times.
> 
> The following day Rowan died. His cause of death is not yet known. The review found that 'staff on The Gardener Unit did not follow Trust policy regarding observations' and 'the abnormal blood results were not communicated to the Unit due to a range of issues.'
> 
> A date is yet to be set for a full inquest into the death of the third youngster, Ania Sohail.
> 
> But at an inquest opening hearing in July last year it was revealed that Ania died after becoming drowsy during dinner, at the junction 17 unit for adolescents and young people at Prestwich, before saying she had taken a large amount of medication.
> 
> The inquest heard that it is not known how Ania, who had been at risk of self harm and had been on five minute observations, obtained the medication. A date is yet to be set for a full inquest.
> 
> Gill Green, Chief Nurse for Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust said of the latest developments: "The Trust has been asked by NHS England and NHS Improvement to commission an independent report into the three tragic incidents; to be undertaken by an external organisation to ensure complete neutrality wherever possible. This is in addition to conducting our own robust reviews into each of the incidents.
> 
> "We are cooperating fully with the inquest process and will share the findings of our report with the families, our commissioner, NHS England, NHS Improvement, and the Coroner."
> 
> Asked when the report would be complete and who would carry it out a spokesperson for the Trust said it was "too early in the process" to say.
> 
> 
> Prestwich Hospital
> In a statement NHS England said: "I can confirm that following discussion with the trust, NHS England and NHS Improvement recommended that the trust commission an independent report in order to ensure complete neutrality in that work. We will be supporting the trust to determine the terms of reference for that work to ensure it is robust and independent."
> 
> The Manchester Evening News understands that an internal Trust investigation into Ania's death is not yet concluded.
> 
> It is understood that once the local investigations by the Trust conclude then the intention is for the Trust to commission the external review to look into the learning from these deaths and an overview of the Trusts systems and processes to determine wider learning.
> 
> Rowan's father, Marc, told the M.E.N this was 'totally inadequate'.
> 
> "This is management politics and image control," he said. "It is stalling a full investigation into the management and culture of the Trust.
> 
> "It is not even going to be an external investigation. It is a review - looking into the learning from these deaths - not the causes, not the underlying problems.
> 
> "In my view it is totally inadequate. It will not have the same scope that an investigation by NHS England would have, or the power.
> 
> "We will have to put our faith in NHS England, that they do ensure the terms of reference are robust.
> 
> "But the Trust commissioning the report puts control of the process in the hands of the people under investigation."

//Inquest due: 30 Jan 2023//



> An inquest into the death of a teenager being treated at a mental health unit in Prestwich will be delayed "several months" after the NHS trust in charge was ordered to produce a report into the incident.
> 
> Charlie Millers, 17, died five days after he was found unresponsive in his room at Prestwich Hospital on December 2, 2020 - just weeks after 18-year-old Rowan Thompson died whilst being treated at the same hospital. A few months later, Ania Sohail, 21, also died at the hospital, making her the third young person to die after being treated at Prestwich Hospital in nine months.
> 
> Now, Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust (GMMH), who run the site, have been ordered to commission an "external report" about all three deaths by NHS England. A pre-inquest review held at Rochdale Coroner's Court today, March 8, heard that the inquest into Charlie's death could be delayed by "several months" due to this report.
> 
> READ MORE: Emergency services called to busy Stockport road after person suffers 'medical emergency' on bus
> 
> Assistant coroner Lisa Judge told the court: "The hearing was aborted as a result of NHS England's indication they wanted to conduct an inquiry. I'm afraid I'm not in a position in regards to any identification for a prospected date for the report to be completed."
> 
> The court heard a notification of Charlie's death was sent to the CQC, NHS England, and the care commissioners at the time, but it has taken until now for the report to be ordered as NHS England made the decision to investigate the incidents after a letter from his mum Sam and her legal representatives requested an independent review. Paul Spencer, representing GMMH, explained he did not know how long the report would take, but anticipated it would be "a number of months" before it was completed.
> 
> At the hearing, several statements and medical records were requested from the healthcare providers involved in Charlie's care before his death, whilst he was living with him mum in Old Trafford, with the coroner requesting those be submitted to the court and the family by April. The full inquiry into Charlie's death should have started last week, February 28, in front of a jury.



> The mum of a teenager with a "history of severe self-harm" is questioning why he was left alone in a mental health unit before his death.
> 
> Charlie Millers was found unresponsive in his room in the adolescent wing of Prestwich Hospital, Greater Manchester.
> 
> The 17-year-old had previously had one-to-one monitoring because of his history of self-harm and attempts on his own life, Manchester Evening News reported.
> 
> Charlie was found unresponsive by staff some time after 10pm on December 2.
> 
> He was given CPR at the scene and later put on a life support machine, but died a week ago, on December 7.
> 
> An inquest is due to be held into Charlie's death, at which a coroner will explore the circumstances surrounding the tragedy.

> Jury rules 'neglect' after teenager dies in Prestwich mental health unit
> Monday 31 October 2022 at 6:58pm
>
> In a six-day inquest held at Rochdale Coroners Court, jurors heard that Rowan had 'severely low' levels of potassium before their death, but old out-of-service phone numbers and email issues meant blood test results were not communicated.
> Credit: Manchester Evening News
> A breakdown in communication which stopped vital blood test results reaching a Prestwich mental health unit contributed to a teenager's death, jurors have ruled.
> 
> Rowan Thompson who was an inpatient on the Gardener Unit, died on 3 October 2020.
> 
> In a six-day inquest held at Rochdale Coroners Court, jurors heard that the 18-year-old had 'severely low' levels of potassium before their death.
> 
> But old out-of-service phone numbers and email issues meant blood test results were not communicated from Salford Royal Hospital to Prestwich in time to save their life.
> 
> Rowan, who identified as non-binary and used the pronoun 'they', died following a seizure the next day.
> 
> Members of the jury were sent out to deliberate and after five hours of discussions, concluded that the lack of timely communication on Rowan's blood test results contributed to their death.
> 
> They also ruled that this amounted to 'neglect' - meaning 'a gross failure to provide basic medical care' as a result of the failure.
> 
> The inquest heard that Rowan, who was diagnosed with autism and depression, was first admitted to a mental health hospital after attempting suicide in 2016.
> 
> Following a second admission while living with their mum in southern England, Rowan moved to Barnsley, South Yorkshire, to live with their dad.
> 
> Rowan visited their mum for a weekend shortly after their 17th birthday.
> 
> Summing the evidence up to jurors this morning, coroner Joanne Kearsley said the weekend 'tragically ended with Rowan killing their mum and phoning the police', leading to them being detained under the Mental Health Act and transferred to the medium-secure Gardener Unit in Prestwich.
> 
> The court heard Rowan 'felt they had gained weight' on the Gardener Unit due to 'sugary treats', and they said they wanted to embark on more exercise and focus on three meals a day.
> 
> Rowan began losing weight, but insisted to medics that they had not been inducing their own vomit.
> 
> On 25 September 2020, Rowan collapsed in an episode 'they had not had before', the court heard.
> 
> Following tests, Rowan was found to have low blood pressure, which was linked to an increase in their trazadone medication.
> 
> A week later, Rowan had a blood test to establish a reason for their weight loss, which showed up 'severely low' potassium levels - a condition known as 'severe hypokalaemia'.
> 
> The sample was taken from Prestwich to Salford Royal Hospital on 2 October 2020.
> 
> The results were available by the early afternoon and the inquest heard that the results should have been communicated verbally 'within two hours'.
> 
> Dr Allamedine, clinical director at Northern Care Alliance, explained that an IT issue meant the results were not transferred electronically to the Gardener Unit.
> 
> Both phone numbers held at Salford and recorded on the Gardener Unit's website were also out of service, while an email address given by the Prestwich Site switchboard was also for Skype voice messages rather than written emails.
> 
> The results finally reached the Gardener Unit on 5 October 2020, but this was two days after Rowan's death.
> 
> Toxicologist Dr Stephen Morley told the inquest that Rowan's potassium levels had been 'life-threatening' but a timely admission to hospital could have saved their life, while Rowan's psychiatrist Dr Malik said he would have sent them to A&E straight away had he received the results at the right time.
> 
> The court heard Rowan was last seen out of their room in the morning of 3 October 2020, as they went to do some laundry.
> 
> Just nine out of 24 observations between 7am and 12.45pm were carried out and five members of staff at GMMH were found to have either falsified or failed to correctly carry out observation checks on the ward - but coroner Ms Kearsley told jurors this did not lead to Rowan's death.
> 
> The jury concluded that Rowan had been found having a seizure at 12.54pm and CPR began three minutes later.
> 
> A 999 call was made at 1.03pm and paramedics arrived at Prestwich Site at 1.06pm, but they were only able to find their way to Gardener Unit by 1.26pm.
> 
> Rowan was transferred to North Manchester General Hospital, where they were pronounced dead at 2.25pm.
> 
> Following deliberations, the jury gave the cause of Rowan's death as cardiac arrhythmia due to severe hypokalaemia of unknown cause.
> 
> While finding the breakdown in communication over Rowan's blood test results had contributed to their death, jurors also agreed the falsification of observation checks on the morning of their death were matters of fact in the case, although this did not contribute to Rowan's death.
> 
> Following the jury's findings, coroner Ms Kearsley confirmed three issues she would raise in a prevention of future deaths report - including the ability for paramedics to navigate Prestwich Site, which had caused a delay, and whether blood test forms had been changed to include the correct contact details between GMMH and Northern Care Alliance.
> 
> Ms Kearsley also criticised the lack of CCTV being checked for observations made by staff at Prestwich Site, noting a previous audit found 11 members of staff had not carried out checks properly.
> 
> She said: "Whilst I heard evidence around the auditing of observation sheets, one questions the worthiness of those if the CCTV is not checked also."
> 
> During the inquest, Rowan's father Marc Thompson described them as an 'enigma' and a 'quirky individual', with a 'great sense of humour' and a 'strong sense of right and wrong'.
> 
> Following the inquest, Mr Thompson said : "I’m pleased that through the coroner's investigation we have identified a cause of death which brings me some solace, but tempered by the knowledge that Rowan’s death was totally avoidable - culminating in the jury concluding there was a 'gross failure to provide basic medical care' (neglect).
> 
> "Rowan was a brilliant and unique individual and not a day goes by that I don’t think about them."

> Rebecca Titus-Cobb, a lawyer representing Rowan's family, told the inquest the family had a number of concerns regarding Rowan's treatment while on the unit.
> 
> She said there were 'systemic issues regarding observation of patients on the unit', and that the campaign group Inquest had contacted the Care Quality Commission to express concerns following a number of deaths, including Rowan's.

> 
> However, it is not just the parents of Charlie Millers and Rowan Thompson who have anxieties about the safety of patients under the care of Greater Manchester Mental Health Trust.
> 
> In September the Care Quality Commission conducted an unannounced inspection, 'due to on-going concerns about the safety of services'.
> 
> In the report that followed, the watchdog said it was 'very concerned' about the safety of people using the services of Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Trust.
> 
> They said their inspectors found there was not always enough nursing staff and that permanent staff did not feel safe if bank or agency workers were used as they didn't have the relevant training.
> 
> The charity INQUEST, who campaign with families whose loved ones have died in the custody or care of the state, are also concerned.
> 
> The charity believes that the trust's internal investigations don't go far enough.
> 
> The Manchester Evening News has seen a copy of a letter sent in December by INQUEST Executive Director, Deborah Coles, to Amanda Pritchard, Chief Executive of NHS England.
> 
> In it, Ms Coles writes: "INQUEST is extremely concerned to have learnt of this cluster of deaths in the same area, including two self-inflicted deaths, involving children and young people within a 10-month period.
> 
> "These deaths raise serious questions about the quality of treatment, care and patient safety and we believe they warrant a full and independent investigation."
> 
> She adds: "We are of the view that such an investigation is justified on the basis that at least two of these deaths were self-inflicted deaths involving very vulnerable children and young people, in settings where they should have been safe and therefore represent significant systemic service failures.
> 
> "It does not inspire family confidence to have a Trust investigate itself over a pattern of disturbing deaths.
> 
> "It is essential that this investigation be independent of staff and employees of the Trust.
> 
> "We believe this is the only way of ensuring the families’ and public confidence in the investigatory process and the hope that it can contribute to improved patient safety and the prevention of future deaths."
> 
> An inquest into Charlie's death will take place in February.
> 
> "I know it will take a long time to get answers," his Sam Millers said.
> 
> "I have not got my son, I have not had him for a year because of that place.
> 
> "We are getting support from staff at the unit who telling us we are doing a good thing and to keep going.
> 
> "They have concerns themselves. I think the issues that need looking at are management, a shortage of staff and lack of training and knowledge."
> 
> Rowan's inquest is scheduled for June this year.
> 
> He was accused of murdering his mother and was due to stand trial the week after he was found collapsed.
> 
> He denied murdering Joanna Thompson, 50, at the family home in the village of Hambledon, Hampshire, but had previously pleaded guilty to the mother-of-two's manslaughter.
> 
> Rowan's father, Marc said at the protest: "I am here to support Sam because I believe that Charlie's death was totally avoidable.
