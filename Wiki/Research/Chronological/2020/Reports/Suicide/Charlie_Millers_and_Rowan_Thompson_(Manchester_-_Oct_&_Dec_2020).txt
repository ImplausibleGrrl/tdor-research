> Twenty four hours after the first anniversary of her child's death Sam Millers was tying a banner to railings.
> 
> As Storm Barra whipped up rain and a biting wind she was picketing the entrance to Prestwich Hospital with another grieving parent, Marc Thompson.
> 
> They come from different walks of life and different ends of the country. Marc is from rural Hampshire, and Sam is from Old Trafford.
> 
> But both know the pain of losing a child in the very place that was supposed to keep them safe.
> 
> Marc's son, Rowan, 18, and Sam's child, Charlie, 17, were both in-patients at the Prestwich Hospital when they died.
> 
> They were two of three young people who died there over nine months, and so now their loved ones are demanding an independent investigation.
> 
> As well as their shared grief, Marc and Sam both understand the challenges faced by young people who are gender nonconforming.
> 
> Rowan was non-binary, meaning he did not identify as male or female, while Charlie was trans.
> 
> "(Charlie) was about to start on a medical pathway, but they couldn't commence that due to his mental health," Sam said.
> 
> "He was very supportive to other people with LBGT needs."
> 
> The mother added: "Charlie was about four or five when he began referring to himself as a boy.
> 
> "He was a tomboy during earlier childhood, then aged 11 he said he felt like a boy, and at 12 had his hair cut short and began living as a boy."
> 
> With their children's faces on a six foot placard, the campaigners handed leaflets to members of the public. They have also started an online petition.
> 
> Speaking of the protest, Sam said: "Our aim is to get NHS England's attention to do an investigation into the deaths.
> 
> "The fact that there has been three deaths in nine months is not acceptable.
> 
> "I know they are separate deaths but collectively we think the same issue arises - observation failings. I feel if NHS England get involved they can find out the facts."
> 
> Charlie's death came in December 2020. The former Manchester College pupil had a history of self-harm and was under observation at the time he became fatally ill.
> 
> He had been seen with ligatures around his neck three times before he was found alone and unresponsive, with a fourth ligature around his neck. He died five days later.
> 
> Sam says that she was told her son was being checked on once every five minutes at the time he was fatally injured. She believes he should not have been left alone at all at the time.
> 
> Rowan's death, two months earlier, remains mysterious.
> 
> He was being checked on every 15 minutes because of concerns about self-harm.
> 
> He had been experiencing weight loss in the last weeks of his life, at one stage collapsing, and had been undergoing blood tests.
> 
> The day before he died, a sample indicated he had 'very low' levels of potassium.
> 
> But the lab was unable to reach anyone at Prestwich Hospital to alert them, despite trying several times, and Rowan died the day after, with the cause of death still unascertained.
> 
> The M.E.N has seen a draft copy of a Serious Incident Review done by the Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust following Rowan's death.
> 
> It found that in Rowan's case, 'staff...did not follow Trust policy regarding observations' and 'the abnormal blood results were not communicated to the Unit due to a range of issues.'
> 
> The third young person to die was Ania Sohail, 21, in June last year.
> 
> She became ill after becoming drowsy during dinner, before saying she had taken a large amount of medication.
> 
> The opening of an inquest in July heard it's not yet known how she got that medication. She too was at risk of self-harm, and was on a routine of five-minute observations, ie check-ups.
> 
> Demanding answers, the grieving families of Charlie Millers and Rowan Thompson
> "When you have three deaths that are so similar in a short space of time you have to start looking at the strategic management of the unit," Marc Thompson told the Manchester Evening News.
> 
> "That is not effectively being done by the Trust, and that's where we need NHS England.
> 
> "We know that the issues with staffing problems at Prestwich were there prior to Covid taking place.
> 
> "We have documented evidence in Rowan's Serious Incident Review that he was unable to attend college which is less than 100 yards from the ward because they didn't have a staff member to escort him to his classroom.
> 
> "This is about management, a lack of staffing a strategic vision from the middle and higher management of an NHS Trust.
> 
> "We believe they need to be held accountable for their decisions and lack of staffing, because we believe that has in part caused the death of my child, the death of a second child, and a third.
> 
> "How many deaths does it need for them to pull their finger out, say we need to sort our staffing levels out, because these are national centres?
> 
> "They are taking patients from around the country because they are a vital service.
> 
> "If you haven't got the staff you can't take the patients in because you can't deliver the quality of care that is needed.
> 
> "In that aspect we believe that Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Trust have failed.
> 
> " I am quite happy to wait three or four year after his death to let NHS England get to the root of the problem.
> 
> "Rowan's and Charlie's deaths are symptoms of a bigger problem. If we don't deal with the bigger problem how many more children are going to die?"
> 
> Where are the coronavirus support groups near where you live? Find out by adding your postcode.
> 
> The Manchester Evening News has put all of campaigners' claims to the trust, who have told us that the 'highest quality care and treatment is at the heart of everything we do'.
> 
> However, it is not just the parents of Charlie Millers and Rowan Thompson who have anxieties about the safety of patients under the care of Greater Manchester Mental Health Trust.
> 
> In September the Care Quality Commission conducted an unannounced inspection, 'due to on-going concerns about the safety of services'.
> 
> In the report that followed, the watchdog said it was 'very concerned' about the safety of people using the services of Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Trust.
> 
> They said their inspectors found there was not always enough nursing staff and that permanent staff did not feel safe if bank or agency workers were used as they didn't have the relevant training.
> 
> The charity INQUEST, who campaign with families whose loved ones have died in the custody or care of the state, are also concerned.
> 
> The charity believes that the trust's internal investigations don't go far enough.
> 
> The Manchester Evening News has seen a copy of a letter sent in December by INQUEST Executive Director, Deborah Coles, to Amanda Pritchard, Chief Executive of NHS England.
> 
> In it, Ms Coles writes: "INQUEST is extremely concerned to have learnt of this cluster of deaths in the same area, including two self-inflicted deaths, involving children and young people within a 10-month period.
> 
> "These deaths raise serious questions about the quality of treatment, care and patient safety and we believe they warrant a full and independent investigation."
> 
> She adds: "We are of the view that such an investigation is justified on the basis that at least two of these deaths were self-inflicted deaths involving very vulnerable children and young people, in settings where they should have been safe and therefore represent significant systemic service failures.
> 
> "It does not inspire family confidence to have a Trust investigate itself over a pattern of disturbing deaths.
> 
> "It is essential that this investigation be independent of staff and employees of the Trust.
> 
> "We believe this is the only way of ensuring the families’ and public confidence in the investigatory process and the hope that it can contribute to improved patient safety and the prevention of future deaths."
> 
> An inquest into Charlie's death will take place in February.
> 
> "I know it will take a long time to get answers," his Sam Millers said.
> 
> "I have not got my son, I have not had him for a year because of that place.
> 
> "We are getting support from staff at the unit who telling us we are doing a good thing and to keep going.
> 
> "They have concerns themselves. I think the issues that need looking at are management, a shortage of staff and lack of training and knowledge."
> 
> Rowan's inquest is scheduled for June this year.
> 
> He was accused of murdering his mother and was due to stand trial the week after he was found collapsed.
> 
> He denied murdering Joanna Thompson, 50, at the family home in the village of Hambledon, Hampshire, but had previously pleaded guilty to the mother-of-two's manslaughter.
> 
> Rowan's father, Marc said at the protest: "I am here to support Sam because I believe that Charlie's death was totally avoidable.
> 
> "When Rowan passed away there were issues with observations and the Trust has acknowledged that.
> 
> "The management team of his ward also managed Charlie's unit. Yet within three months there's another death where observations of patients are key.
> 
> "I know people will say there have been independent reviews done within the Trust and those Serious Incident Reviews have given us a lot of information and shone light on issues within the Trust.
> 
> "But they are not truly independent."
> 
> Asked to comment on the call for an inquiry by NHS England and the claims made by Marc Thompson and Sam Millers, the Trust said: "We have nothing further to add to our previous statements."
> 
> Responding to the M.E.N's enquiries about the series of deaths, Gill Green, director of nursing and governance at Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust (GMMH) said in July this year: “The death of a service user is always an extremely tragic and distressing event, and we continue to send our heartfelt condolences to all those who have been affected.
> 
> 
> Prestwich Hospital
> “At GMMH, providing the highest quality care and treatment is at the heart of everything we do, and we are committed to continuous learning and improvement in order to achieve this.
> 
> “We treat the death of a service user with the utmost seriousness.
> 
> "In the event of a serious incident or death, we follow a rigorous review process to understand the circumstances in which it happened.
> 
> "We develop thorough recommendations, which are translated into a detailed action plan to reduce the risk of such incidents ever happening again.
> 
> "The completion of this action plan is closely monitored and highly prioritised.
> 
> “We recognise the value of the insight that the loved ones of our service users bring to this process.
> 
> "Throughout, we work closely with families and carers to ensure their thoughts and observations are heard, and to offer continued support at these times of tragedy.
> 
> “We foster an open and honest culture across the Trust, and always encourage staff to speak freely about any mistakes they have made or areas for improvement they have observed.
> 
> "We work closely with our staff to learn and grow as an organisation from these experiences.”
> 
> An online petition via change.org calling for an NHS England inquiry has just under 500 names.
