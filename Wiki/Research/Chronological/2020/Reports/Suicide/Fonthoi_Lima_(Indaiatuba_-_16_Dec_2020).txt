I think this was the case I saw on Facebook.... she was found in the ecological park in Indaiatuba, right?


"She said he was a wonderful person, with a big heart, but couldn't stand prejudice"

"Poliana Azevedo I saw a testimony from a friend of his, said he was even expelled from the wake because he paid tribute to him with that name. I'll see if I think and I'll post it here"

UPLOAD.
I have just buried one of the most special people in my life, Fonthoi Lima. Yesterday, around 12 noon, we received a call that said Fonthoi had committed suicide. At the time, I was with my friend Lucas Alexsander and with great despair we went to the place of the event, where Fonthoi was, already lifeless. Fonthoi was an LGBTQIA + person, who lately was recognizing himself as a non-binary person (that is, a person who did not identify with either the male or the female, who was outside this binary) and who constantly denounced the violations that a dissident, black body suffers in this society. Fonthoi couldn't take all this violence and decided to end all suffering by taking his own life, and so we lost a great person, who, in truth, did not commit suicide, but she was killed by this LGBTIphobic and racist society. Anyone who knows Fonthoi knows the huge heart he has, his kindness, sweetness, empathy and sensitivity and how much he taught us, even at the time of his death, as he was dressed socially while wearing women's clothing and with red nails, obviously aiming to show us part of who he really was, showing his desire, his identity - so long repressed by fear. Today, when we were saying goodbye to Fonthoi, I tried to make a speech and pronounced his real name: Fonthoi, at this moment I was prevented from continuing my speech, I was prevented from saying goodbye, from showing how much our community was proud and love for did not accept that Fonthoi is Fonthoi. It’s a delicate, difficult, painful moment, but I couldn’t help writing all of this here, because Fonthoi really wanted to teach something ... I wonder, how long are we going to bury our fellowmen? How long will hatred, ignorance and prejudice rule our society? Fonthoi, partner, we will miss you here. You are eternal. Our princess". We love you,Fonthoi Lima.
My sentiments to all!
Destá!
