We sympathize with family and friends in this time of pain, and with all loved ones.

Although he has not yet been sworn in, he has long participated in the work of this commission. He was among us in this daily and tireless struggle against prejudice and LGBT phobia. It had a glow in the natural look. An insistent smile on his face. He dreamed and embarked on plans and ideals instantly. He was a great man!

It is with regret that the ATRACT - Association of Travesties and Transgender of Tocantins State regrets the passing of fellow Igor Lima Potencio.

This is a lawyer and militant of the transgender cause. Igor would be impossible as the first transgender leader of OAB, sectional Tocantins this Monday, 06/29/2020, eve of the date of his 25th birthday (06/30/2020).

Igor's suicide on June 28th in which the International LGBTQI + Pride Day is commemorated and brings out the pressing need for discussion about racism, LGBTphobia and the depression experienced by the community. And in that context it is important to stress that many transgender people face very intimate processes of self-recognition through gender transition.

Rest in peace, mate, in every struggle we resist to exist, you will be rememorated as an icon and martyr of our fight here in Tocantins state.

Igor GIFT, Today and ALWAYS!
