suicide
 

Yuri reportedly died by suicide. It appears that rejection by his birth family may have been a factor.

> I don't know if the cause was the lack of family acceptance for being trans, but a while ago before that happened I witnessed a very sad situation with him. He went to the supermarket where work desperate and was going to take 2 packs of poison to rats, in which the taxman didn't let him take because he fears the worst. The tax officer contacted his uncle in which he lived, the answer was ' ' if you want to die, die there ". And today I received this news, he just had no one for him.
