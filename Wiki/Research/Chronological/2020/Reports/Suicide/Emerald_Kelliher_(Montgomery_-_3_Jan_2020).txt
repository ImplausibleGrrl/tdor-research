Emerald Kelliher, age 31 died by suicide on January 3, 2020 at the burial site of her beloved dog Zorro on a family property outside of Montgomery, AL. 
Here is the notice published by her religious community, of which I am the pastor: 
Emerald M. Kelliher, 31, a resident of Montgomery, AL, passed away on Friday, January 3rd, 2020. Emerald was born on September 25, 1988 in Enterprise, Alabama.

She is also survived by her brother, Phillip Kelliher (Glenda), her sisters, Susan Kelliher, Margot Whatley and Amber Rice (Brandon). She is also survived by numerous nieces and nephews as well as other extended family members. Emerald was preceded in death by her grandparents and her sister, Bridget Mary Kelliher. Emerald graduated from Loveless Academic Magnet Program in May of 2007. Upon graduation, she was awarded a Congressional German Scholarship. Emerald had a deep love for animals including her beloved companion, Zorro. She also worked, for a period time, with her dad, at his veterinary clinic.

I have no preference regarding attribution; I am out in public, as was Emerald. I was honored and blessed to be her friend as well as her pastor.

At the start of the year, we suffered another tragic loss of our close community member and volunteer, Emerald Kelliher. She will be deeply missed - and remembered for her flouncy hats, joyous spirit, and generous warmth. Among other things, she was an activist, daughter, care-taker and friend.

As quarantine casts a shadow over its community, Montgomery Pride United is fighting to protect every LGBTQ person who feels isolated, lonely, or unseen. 

Pride has never looked like this before. Parades are canceled. Gatherings are a public health concern. But that hardly means that Pride is canceled; scores of people have taken to the street in protest for Black Lives Matter. For those who can't, celebrating Pride in quarantine is a protest itself. This month, Esquire is examining what Pride means now, beyond the parade and for the next 50 years—whether it's advocating for justice over Zoom, discovering the intersectionality too often missing from Pride, or simply existing as a trans father. The protest continues.

There was a woman named Emerald who lived in Montgomery, Alabama, for a good part of her 31 years, but she’s gone now. If you Google her name, there is only one result about her—a Facebook post from her church about a memorial service following her suicide this past January. The results are instead flooded with stories about 31-year-old Dana Martin, because, as misfortune would have it, Dana was murdered in Montgomery the January before. That’s two years in a row that Montgomery women were the nation’s first trans casualties. In a queer community as small as Montgomery’s, that echoes like a firecracker in an oil barrel. 

 Echoes ring in your ear for months to come. That’s evident as about 10 of Montgomery Pride United’s 50 or so members gather on a Zoom call in late May for a monthly storytelling event that is usually held in person. One of the advocacy group’s founders talks about growing up in Montgomery, recalling a memory of herself as a girl, when she laid on the ground and poured her energy into the earth. One member decides to read a couple passages from his journal about Emerald. His camera jostles a bit as he struggles to hold it and the journal and his tears. Jose Vazquez, the organization’s president, sends me a private message to explain that Emerald was beloved among MPU. Frankly, this is a very intimate Zoom call for a stranger to join. But to read a description of an MPU storytelling hour is one thing. To join in is to be immediately engulfed in the community. 

Montgomery, a city of nearly 200,000, has just one Pride organization. Meta Ellis and her wife Emma McDaniel-Ellis brought it to life only five years ago along with the community center that houses it, which has been around for three. They use a lot of hard work, small donations, and relentless passion to keep the program going. The year started with Emerald’s passing, and with COVID-19—in a city where being queer can already be isolating—the distance that the coronavirus quarantine has put between members feels so far and so thick and so incredibly lonely at times.

The first known and reported suicide of a transgender person in the U.S. in 2020 occurred Friday, January 3 in Montgomery, Alabama.
	 Less than one year after the murder of Dana Martin - the first reported transgender victim of murder in the U.S. in 2019 - occurred in Montgomery, the LGBTQ community is once again mourning the death of a transgender person.
	 Emerald Kelliher -  31 years of age - died Friday, January 3. Emerald had many friends in the LGBTQ+ community in Montgomery, and was well known and loved especially by the transgender and gender-nonconforming community.
	 She is described by her friends as being bubbly, and a great conversationalist. She was also an activist, a daughter, a lover of animals, a  beacon of light and a bright jewel, and someone who dearly loved her friends.
	 Those that knew Emerald knew that besides being so delightfully different and gender non-conforming and could absolutely rock that little black dress and her floppy hats, knew also that she suffered from mental illness. She had many friends who would sit with her for hours while she poured out her heart. She tried in many different ways to find the root of her depression and frustration. She was desperate for peace.
	  Emerald will be honored and mourned at a Grief and Loss Support Group hosted by Montgomery PRIDE United Monday evening, January 6th at the Bayard Rustin Community Center located at 635 Madison Ave. in downtown Montgomery and in a memorial service January 11th at 7 PM at the Unitarian Universalists Fellowship 2810 Atlanta Hwy, Montgomery, Alabama 36109.

Emerald was a cherished member of the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Montgomery, and of the community service coalition Montgomery Pride United. She was known as someone who would always step up when someone was in need, even if there was nothing she could do. She had nothing, but she shared everything without reservation. She never sought to disturb or disrupt, but her truth telling often cause disruption and she bore the cost of it. She would not bend or compromise to suit others, and took the hot glares of society and her own family rather than diminish her own truth.

Emerald was an avid singer, a tireless volunteer, a skilled debater, a vibrant actor, and a lover of animals of all types. She struggled with bipolar depression for many years, and though she continued to seek treatment and took her meds, she could never find lasting relief. After the death of her beloved companion dog Zorro in 2019, she began a downward spiral from which she could not recover. Finally unable to see any hope of relief from the crushing pain and relentless isolation in her illness, she ended her own life alone at the Zorro's gravesite.
