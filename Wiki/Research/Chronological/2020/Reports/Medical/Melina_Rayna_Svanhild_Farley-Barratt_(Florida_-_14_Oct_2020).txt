GAINESVILLE, Fla. (WCJB) - Melina Rayna Barratt lost her battle with thyroid cancer Tuesday night although her legacy lives on.

“And anytime she came to our campus she was making it a better place,” said Sarah Blanc, the Civic Engagement and Service specialist at Santa Fe College. She kept Barratt at close quarters to keep students engaged in social justice; an area Barratt was heavily involved with

“Because she could draw in any student with her warmth and her outgoing personality and get them engaged in a discussion about important issues,” added Blanc. “And also, one of the biggest reasons that I loved bringing Melina around our students is she was such a role model for using your power.”

Barratt wanted to use her power to fight for equity for all women by running for public office. She was running for the 5th district State Senate seat as a Democrat against Republican Jennifer Bradley.

“Vote for Melina despite the fact that she’s crossed over,” added Lakey Love, the secretary of Florida National Organization for Women.

As the Legislative Director of FL NOW, Barratt traveled to Tallahassee for the legislative session to be a voice for marginalized communities.

“(Barrett) was never ashamed of saying she’s a trans woman,” said Love. “She’s the first trans woman to run for the Florida Senate and a vote for Melina still this voting season is a vote for the power of not only women but for transgender people and active feminists who are fighting patriarchy and misogyny here in the state of Florida.”

Members of the FL NOW have set up a GoFundMe page for Barratt’s family to help pay for the cost of a memorial service.


A Florida transgender and women’s rights activist who was running for the state's Senate died of cancer Wednesday.

Melina Rayna Svanhild Farley-Barratt, legislative director for the National Organization for Women’s Florida chapter, was in hospice care at the time of her death.

“A sad day: Melina Rayna Barratt, Democratic candidate for FL Senate Dist. 5 has passed on,” tweeted Barbara Byram, a House candidate who knew Farley-Barratt.


When she first announced her candidacy, Farley-Barratt spoke to The Advocate about running. While a long shot running in a majority Republican north-central Florida district against GOP nominee Jennifer Bradley, wife of the outgoing state senator for the district, she remained optimistic about what her candidacy could bring.

Fueled by victories for trans candidates like Virginia Del. Danica Roem, she felt hopeful about the chance for greater representation in legislatures.

“It’s been a progression,” Farley-Barratt said. “Right now is a great time. I think in two years it will be better.”

She told Florida Politics she had considered running for other offices before choosing the open Senate seat. She passed on running for Congress. “The Florida Senate is easier to manage,” the experienced lobbyist said.

She felt a greater diversity of perspectives in politics would improve life for all.
“When a hammer is your only solution, every problem looks like a nail,” she said in her Advocate interview. “That’s why it’s important have many different people, a different tool in toolbox for every problem.”

She was just the second trans candidate in Florida to qualify for the ballot for a state legislative race.

Even before running, Farley-Barratt was among the most high-profile trans activists in the state, testifying on LGBTQ+ issues to the Florida legislature routinely.

Since 2012, she had been receiving treatment for metastatic follicular thyroid carcinoma that started in her thyroid and spread to her spine. She discussed her fight with the illness with Florida public broadcaster WUFT, something she waged while continuing to lobby on women’s issues. She told the outlet it was during that fight she decided to come out.

Florida NOW Secretary Lakey Love has established a fund to cover memorial and cremation costs for Farley-Barratt.

“Melina is well known for her feminist work battling for the equity and rights of women and LGBTQIA+ equity in Florida's Capitol, throughout the state, and around the nation,” a GoFundMe page reads. “She is the first transgender woman candidate to run for election as a legislator in the Florida Senate and, even in ill health, she fought bitterly to stop the bitter discrimination against transgender and gender non-conforming people.”
