"Tuberculosis is the most common infectious disease in people who have HIV. When someone is diagnosed with TB, they automatically have to take exams to see if they have hiv or not. It's a deadly mixture for the ease how TB can enter a hiv bearer's body + the ease TB has to kill that person, for having immunity greatly weakened."

"People with HIV have 28 more chances of contracting TB than a person without hiv."
