On Saturday, Lady Red Couture, a staple of the Los Angeles drag community, died. Jonny McGovern, who co-hosted the long-running show Hey Qween alongside Lady Red Couture, announced the news on social media.

"It doesn't feel real but the beautiful light that was Lady Red is gone," he wrote. "I love you baby. I will miss you every day."

A week prior McGovern had posted to social media that he had rushed Lady Red to the hospital due to complications with cyclic vomiting syndrome, a chronic condition that the performer suffered from. At the time McGovern asked for donations to help her Lady Red with her bills given that she was in the intensive care unite. On Friday McGovern reported that she had been on a breathing tube and unconscious for five days but was stabilizing. McGovern has said that "ALL the generous donations to her Venmo over this week" will go towards funeral costs.

On social media, many in the drag and nightlife communities as well as entertainment in general have posted tributes. On Hey Qween, McGovern and Lady Red interviewed many RuPaul's Drag Race alum and other talented people. 

"Last week I filmed a new Hey Qween interview and Lady Red was out sick so we talked to her as if she was there," actress Isis King wrote two twitter. "She was going to film her parts later on, now she's gone." King went on to write that the icon would be "missed by many." Others like Detox, Shangela, Jackie Beat, and many more all posted.
