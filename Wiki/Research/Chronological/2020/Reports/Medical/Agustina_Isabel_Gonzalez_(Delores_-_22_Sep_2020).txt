Argentina] [Buenos Aires] [Dolores] [trans] [institutional violence]
Deep sadness and too much rant gives us what happened to fellow trans Agustina Isabel Gonzalez, in the city of Dolores, Buenos Aires province.
The 27-year-old girl died after fighting cancer; her short life had been among all kinds of abuse, extreme violence, living in the street or in houses that shelter her for a while; nothing we have not referred to What happens to the trans community in Argentina.
′′ With the help of different groups-first Altenativxs, then Women and Diversities Dolorense, and finally the newly created provincial ministry of Women and Diversity-could assume that the 'natural' was not such, that violence and indignity were not parties 'normal' of life. He learned to fight for his dignity, although this will take a high price ", quote the note. In 2014 he was able to make his record change.
Agustina struggled to get rights that had been taken away from her: ′′ ' a decent and safe shelter under habitability ', ' health care interdisciplinary ' which would include psychologists, social worker, and follow up on her HIV and treatments and Cancer, incorporation into a Training Program and job insertion ", but as with many trans companions, whose average life is between 35 and 40 years, didn't reach. References the note that ′′ in his favor the Dolores Court of First Instance, and the Mar del Plata Appeals Chamber The case came to the provincial Supreme Court ", as the Dolores Municipality appealed all the judgements.
In response to the request of a coffin, to watch their remains, from their colleagues, the municipality sent them ′′ a box of apples ", ′′ a cardboard coffin ", as two of their friends said, what we do not find for nothing strange.
We will follow the case closely waiting for the Supreme Court to rule in favor of a young woman who can no longer benefit, but who can set a precedent for the municipality of Dolores to arbitrate all the means to grant equal rights and access full to the same for the rest of your trans companions.


A cardboard drawer for a dead transvestite
Agustina Isabel González was only 27 years old, had cancer and was living with HIV. She suffered abuse of all kinds: beatings, mass rapes, mistreatment of her occasional partners. He lived on the street or in different houses without the basic elements that dignity and his illness demanded. Despite the fact that the law protected her, the Municipality of Dolores systematically refused to comply with her rights. As a corollary, before his death they sent a cardboard box. 
By Juan Carlos Sánchez Sottosanto

"It looked like a box of apples," commented a colleague. "A cardboard coffin!" Said another. "Why should a coffin be paid with my taxes?" A worthy grandson of a local accomplice - we are in Dolores, Buenos Aires province - spat into the networks of the Dictatorship. "Now he is in heaven with the little angels", the pious souls were consoled who, today on Facebook as in the past in the paper obituaries, look every afternoon for the new deceased. 

Sighing is easy in a city under the invocation of a Virgin always suffering and that even its plane is shaped like a cross. In the morning, the municipal director of Childhood and Gender, Francisco Stea, had been shouted at by Cecilia Coronel, from the Dolorenses Women and Diversities collective. Since the Municipality had behaved so badly with Agustina, that at least the coffin was worthy of the young dead goddess. Of course, of course, Estea said. The cynical response was a cardboard box; Capra, Dolores's classic funeral company, dumped her around from a small truck. "Out there" is the ossuary of the nameless and without a niche; the hole was badly dug, had to be narrowly finished with fingernails. The black, the trava, the AIDS, the whore, the moron, had to be humiliated to the last.

Agustina Isabel González was only 27 years old when she died; He had a slight maturational delay, and he suffered from HIV, to which was added a cancer that began as a toothache and ended in fulminant metastasis. He met his mother, now deceased; his father never took over. She suffered abuse of all kinds: beatings, mass rapes, mistreatment of her occasional partners. He lived on the street or in different houses without the basic elements that dignity and growing pathologies demanded. I have naturalized violence; she was prostituted and begged. He was looking for other forms of life; She asked to be called to sweep sidewalks, run errands, cut the grass, whatever. Even when he no longer had the strength for it. But with the help of different groups –first Altenativxs, then Mujeres y Diversidades Dolorense, and finally, the newly created provincial ministry of Women and Diversities - was able to assume that the "natural" was not such, that violence and indignity were not "normal" parts of life. He learned to fight for his dignity, even if it came at a high price. By 2014 he obtained his document proving his assumed identity; He almost forgot his "man's" name. But the suffering intensified. Her facebook is a good witness of her illusions, of her yearnings for life and, also, for the death that freed her from Calvary. The case of cancer is paradigmatic: when it only seemed like a swelling of the teeth, she refused to go to the local hospital, because she was already fed up with the discrimination and humiliation she suffered there. that violence and indignity were not "normal" parts of life.

Agustina accumulated rulings in her favor, and in favor of "decent and safe accommodation in habitable conditions", as well as "interdisciplinary health care" that would include psychologist, social worker, and follow-up of her HIV treatments and cancer, the incorporation to a Program of Training of Trades and the labor insertion. In his favor, the Court of First Instance of Dolores and the Court of Appeals of Mar del Plata ruled. The case reached the provincial Supreme Court, but today Agustina is dead, and in her cardboard box. Because the Municipality appealed all the rulings, adducing troglodyte arguments of this kind: a person with HIV is a danger to the health system; We have no evidence of their marginality or gender violence; if she prostitutes herself with HIV it is because she wants to harm others. It was enough to see any of his occasional habitats, or photos with his face made a single shapeless bruise, to know who was lying. The author of such exquisite arguments is Dr. Marina Etchevarren, sister of the ineffable mayor of Dolores, Camilo Etchevarren. Nepotism abounds in these pampas of God.

Beyond the right of appeal, the Municipality was obliged to comply with the prescriptions; that is, renting a home for a year, and including it in a neighborhood plan in perpetuity; provide medical, psychological and social help. Of course, he did not comply. He settled for handing over a carafe and a pair of slippers. In the terminal stage, she was detained in the Hospital, despite being a person at risk from the covid. It is that the Lord Mayor uses municipal funds for obscenities and bizarre investments more in line with his profile as a ranch foreman with a new facón: he builds hot springs on garbage dumps and rotten waters, he spends a third of GDP on the town's bicentennial for Luis Fonzi to sing "Despacito" and Cacho Castaña expose their senile machirulence, decrees that the city have two carnivals to differentiate itself from the rest of the cosmos, it makes a half-block pedestrian that muddles traffic, dismantles the hospital, and prohibits a woman with a dead fetus from entering it. What he cannot tame with faconazos is his own innate misery, his violence that leaves him more and more exposed to being a Ubu king given to the tantrum and the obscene display of his unbridled power.

We hope that the Provincial Court will not only give an exemplary ruling, but that there will also be an economic and moral compensation that will be turned to help many other victims who walk in the payments of the suffering Virgin. Many whores and cakes were able to flee from the suffocation and deafening silences of that town. But the poorest cannot. They remain there, in the helplessness of that crucifix-shaped plane, and when they die –and how early–, they only have a cardboard box left to rot under another cross, the Southern Cross, which shines in that sky that is never theirs.
