cardiorespiratory arrest


Tamara's body was found lying in a ditch of water, a day after she had been discharged from hospital. Her cause of death is unknown.

> On Saturday, April 25 at sunset, Tamara Denise Morales - a 36-year-old trans woman - was transferred by ambulance from the Villa de Mayo house where she lived with her family, to the Malvinas Argentinas hospital guard. She felt very ill and they were going to do various tests, including a coronavirus test, her friends said. She was in the hospital from between 8:00 p.m. to 3:00 a.m., when - according to what the hospital announced - she asked to be voluntarily discharged and left. Her family and friends did not hear from her and on Sunday they desperately asked on the networks if anyone had seen her, they should contact them. Eventually the police found her dead.
