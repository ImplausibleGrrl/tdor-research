presumed sepsis


It is extremely difficult for me to write this message.
I have to inform you all that our sister Chrissy Valentine died last weekend presumably from sepsis due to an infection she had which was untreated. Many of us had recent contact with her and all who had, urged her to call for medical help. She declined to do so, which was her way but it also became her end.

The last any of us heard from her was Saturday Morning in a tweeted message where she said she intended to finally relent and go to the ER. It appears that for whatever reason she was never able to make that call for transport.
In the days that followed, I called several hospitals in the region, multiple times, to try and confirm she had made it in since her phone was offline and she couldn't be reached.

On Tuesday a mutual friend went to her building and tried to rouse her in the morning and got no response at all. I next contacted Sacramento PD whereupon they did a “welfare check” which also amounted to knocking on her door, but they did not enter her apartment. Out of urgency I finally got a message to her father on Wednesday morning. He was able to gain access to her apartment and He found her deceased. The preliminary opinion of the coroner is that she had succumbed to the massive infection days previously. So none of our efforts would have made a difference in this outcome. All other information is pending.

When her dad called me back last night, I did ask him to please honor her death by using her correct name and pronouns in any announcements proceedings, and he agreed to do so.
In Kind, he also asked me to withhold notifying anyone via social media for a day until her family and son could be informed of her passing.
As more information becomes available I will share it, and also about any arrangements that are planned. I am sorry I was unable to share all of this immediately upon learning it.

Please share this statement now with our mutual friends so we can get the word out to everyone who loved her.

Thank you to everyone who helped try to find assistance for her.

Here's to you, Chrissy Valentine, our fierce warrior goddess.
I will never forget you, my friend."
