SALTA ( Critical Voices Writing ) In the first minutes of this Thursday, the sad news of the death of Vanesa Sander , a reference of the trans struggle in Salta, was known. 

Undoubtedly, it is news that fell like a bucket of cold water, so family and friends fired her with heartfelt messages on social networks. The trans woman was struggling against a harsh situation that worsened in the last hours. 

ccording to the information released, "she had been hospitalized for several days for pneumonia and her health worsened in the last hours ." 

She was assisted from the first moment in the Papa Francisco hospital , but her body did not withstand the onslaught of an illness that "took her on a tour elsewhere," according to her friends. 

Vanesa was one of the first activists and references in the province, that is why she is remembered as one of the pioneers in the fight for transgender employment.
