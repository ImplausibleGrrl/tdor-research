DeVayne, who was born Zavion Davenport, appeared in two series of a hit reality show, in 2016 and 2018. Having been hospitalized earlier this year for suspected kidney failure, DeVayne had to return to the hospital with pneumonia. In a video message last week, DeVayne had asked fans to "keep me in your prayers, I'll be back soon."

DeVayne had been diagnosed in 2018 with scleroderma, an autoimmune condition that causes the body's connective tissues to scar and harden.

A statement from DeVayne's family described her tremendous grief, adding that "the last words to the family and fans were 'never give up.'

World of Wonder, the Drag Race production company, released a statement saying they were "heartbroken" upon hearing the news, adding that DeVayne "spread a message of love and kindness that really touched every person he met." Rest in power, Chi Chi. "

Leading the tributes on Twitter , Drag Race host RuPaul said DeVayne was a "kind and beautiful soul ... may your generous and loving spirit shine on us all."

Shea Coule√©, winner of the most recent series of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars , said: "I am devastated and sick to my stomach. Wake me up when it's all over."

The Louisiana-born artist became famous during the eighth season of Drag Race, which aired in 2016. DeVayne also appeared on the third season of All Stars.

The Drag Race franchise, a global success, now has several international spin-offs, including in Canada and Thailand. Baga Chipz, a finalist for the first series of the British version of the show, said DeVayne was "so nice to me at a time when I was very low." I just sat here crying. RIP your beautiful angel. "
