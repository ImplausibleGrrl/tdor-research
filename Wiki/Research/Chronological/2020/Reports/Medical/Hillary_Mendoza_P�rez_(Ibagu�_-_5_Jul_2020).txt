Hillary, only 18 years old had been in Ibagué for a few months , had arrived before the emergency of COVID-19 was declared and planned to be alone while passing through the musical city, however, due to isolation she had to stay in the capital of Tolima, bearing all the abuses of which the members of the trans community are victims .

With Alejandra and Hillary they lived with other women from this community, some dedicated to selling their bodies, others to selling reds in the Plaza de la 21, but they all collaborated to live as well as possible in the midst of the pandemic . 

For the last days of June Hillary told Alejandra that she had made contact with a friend who came from Bogotá and that she was going to apply a substance to her buttocks, to which Alejandra told her to think about it, that it was dangerous , even more so when she took hormones which helped her to transition. 

But Hillary had a dream, to look prettier, more feminine , so after working and raising a good amount of money, she sent her mother in Venezuela a birthday gift that she wanted to give her, and with illusion she decided to practice this intervention. 

Alejandra told Alert Tolima of the Popular News of La Cariñosa that to this day she does not know who was the one who operated on her friend , just remember that last Monday holiday she left early in the morning and returned at about three o'clock the happy afternoon with his new body. 

All her friends congratulated her and shared the happiness of her change, however, the joy would not last long, as a few days later Hillary began to feel ill. 

And is that Alejandra knew that there were many inconsistencies in that operation of Hillary, since the intervention was carried out in a few hours and there was no hospitalization process , nor were they given any medication to treat pain, nor was there a medical follow-up to see how The patient was evolving, only two injections were given to her buttocks and she was told to bandage her tail and abdomen so that the liquid did not spread to other parts of her body and become fixed in the buttocks. 

What followed next can only be described as a real nightmare, Hillary's pain, fever and general discomfort became increasingly unbearable, but she insisted that she felt good , however, last Sunday her situation worsened , being evident to her colleagues that they had to take her to a hospital. 

That day Alejandra was not there, she was on the 18th with 2nd working, however, the other colleagues attended to Hillary and took her in a taxi to the nearest hospital.

For a moment the group that accompanied Hilarry saw the light of hope shine when noticing that her friend seemed to get better, but this was only the calm before the storm, a couple of minutes later the body of the young Venezuelan woman collapsed and He couldn't control his sphincters, starting to vomit blood. 

When they arrived at the hospital Federico Lleras Acosta it was too late, Hillary had died and nothing could be done anymore, her body came under the custody of the prosecution. 

For now, while Alejandra and her friends mourn the death of Hillary, a relative of this young Venezuelan woman travels to Ibagué to take care of the funeral honors.

Meanwhile, the entire LGBTI community demands that the municipal and departmental health authorities and the Attorney General's Office go to the latest consequences in this case and find the whereabouts of the alleged friend who injected the unknown substance into Hillary, so that the full weight of the law falls on it and this type of tragedy does not happen again.
