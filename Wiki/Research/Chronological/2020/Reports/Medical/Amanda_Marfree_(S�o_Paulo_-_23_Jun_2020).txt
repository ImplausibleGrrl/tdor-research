Covid-19 has made another casualty in our community. Transsexual activist Amanda Marfree died on Tuesday.

Like the Gay Sao Paulo Guide on Facebook

Socio-educational advisor, Amanda worked at the Center for Reference and Defense of Diversity (CRD), in São Paulo.

Very active in social networks and human rights movements, Amanda was a tireless advocate for the LGBT cause, especially the transsexual. During quarantine, she visited trans women in need of assistance.

In the beginning of June, Amanda was one of the highlights of the report of the newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo that talked about how leaders of several generations were dealing with the current Brazilian socio-political conjuncture.

"I was always excluded from everything. Democracy was never a reality for me. Until the 30 years of my life I had no sense of any right, much less citizenship," said the activist in the report.

"In 2015, when I had the opportunity to summarize my studies, in a pilot version of the Transcidadania Project, I understood that I was a citizen like anyone, and not that excluded and marginalized person that society made me believe in."

Amanda, who was born in São Gonçalo (RJ) and lived in the capital of São Paulo, was 35 years old and was a pre-candidate for councilor in São Paulo with the collective DiverCidade SP.

In a note, the collective regretted his departure. "Amanda was doing several volunteer jobs during the pandemic to assist people who needed help in this difficult time, she left a legacy of achievements, overcoming, work and love for others, a life of service to the LGBTQIA + community, of generosity and detachment, especially for transvestites and transsexuals. "



"It is with great sadness that I communicate to all the departures of our beloved friend and companion Amanda Marfree in the morning of this Tuesday, 23/06/2020, victim of Covid-19.

"Amanda leaves a legacy of achievements, overcoming, work and love to the next, a life of service to the LGBT QIA community +, of generosity and unstuck, especially for transvestites and transgender.

"She will be greatly missed by family, friends, militancy and the countless vulnerable people, to whom she dedicated her work until she fell ill.

"Go in peace Amanda, we know God is receiving you right now for the testimony of love you gave on this earth. Amanda's family is already coming to São Paulo for funeral procedures."
