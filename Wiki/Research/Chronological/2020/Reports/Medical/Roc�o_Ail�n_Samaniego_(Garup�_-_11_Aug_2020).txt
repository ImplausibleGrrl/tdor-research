Rocío Ailén Samaniego, a 22-year-old trans woman from Posadas, died at the Fátima hospital in Garupá (Misiones) on August 11, after being hospitalized for 9 days. Her family reported to INADI "discrimination, abandonment and persecution for reasons of gender, social condition and economic position." And today she filed a criminal complaint with the Court of Instruction 7 of Posadas. 

Rocío was the oldest of four siblings and had grown up in Villa Cabello, one of the most populous neighborhoods in the city. She was known for having danced in the “Jacarezinho” troupe of Villa Cabello and in Beleza Samba of Itaembé Miní. She liked to study and had benefited from the Empower Work program. Her surroundings described her as a person full of life and much loved. 


In Posadas there was a march called by the Association From the Street to Dignity. After Rochi's death, ATTTA (Association of Transvestites, Transgender and Transsexuals of Argentina) Misiones - who had been accompanying the family since the young trans woman's hospitalization - published a statement with organizations in repudiation of the acts of discrimination suffered by the entire family.

Nazarena Fleitas from ATTTA Misiones had known her for 7 years, when Rochi began her transition. "Where is the gender identity law, the right to a dignified death, the right to be a subject of care, where is the oath of all these people who are supposedly to defend life? This is not from now, we have lived this since life is life ”, said Fleitas. 

“Everyone deserves dignified attention regardless of religion, social status or gender. That is why we are denouncing the mistreatment of Rocío and her relatives, for the psychological damage they did to us. I also want to denounce the lack of care in the health center and the doctor Carlos Tozzeto, always with discrimination in the middle and mistreatment, ”said Matías Caballero, Rocío's stepfather.

How the family journey began

On August 2 at dawn, Olga, Rocío's mother, found her daughter in the bathroom and became worried. Olga is a nurse, she noticed that her daughter was cyanotic. "We called 107 (Emergency Service) because Rocío was suffering an asthma attack," said Matías. "They told us they were at a changing of the guard, we had to wait a while until they were organized." While they waited, the mother tried to steady her. The ambulance arrived but refused to be transferred to the hospital: "because they are based on the COVID 19 protocol and they said they did not have clothing to transport it," Caballero explained.

The family decided to take her by their own means to the most complex hospital in the province, the Madariaga. “There they made us wait in the guard, she was breaking down more and more, at one point she could hardly breathe. My wife insisted on starting a dialogue with a doctor, who, seeing the state in which Rocío was found, began to shout for quick attention. She had to be intubated because she was already on 64 oxygen saturation (the ambulance nurse took 64 and when she arrived at the hospital she had 60) ”.

According to the family, at the Madariaga the first swab was done with a negative result. Then they were told that they had to transfer her to the Fatima hospital due to lack of beds. "But with the excuse that there they had the best therapists, who were prepared to receive any patient with respiratory problems," said the stepfather. 

The family asked to be transferred to the René Favaloro hospital, located in Villa Cabello, blocks from their home. After a first refusal, they accepted the transfer for Rocío's health ”which took place that same August 2 at around 8:00 p.m. There she had another swab that was also negative.



Pneumonia and discrimination
"While hospitalized in Fatima she gets pneumonia" denounces the family. And they say that "from the first moment we had friction with Dr. Carlos Tozzeto, who told us at all times that Rocío was a man, that she had a man's anatomy, and that he was going to refer to her as a male." Caballero reported that "Rocío had her woman's document and had her birth certificate as a woman because at age 18 she changed her gender." "We explained all this to the doctor, and he told us that for him he was still a man," said the missionary. 

Rocío's mother said that in the last days of hospitalization she saw her daughter “very abandoned. They did not sanitize her, they did not move her, they did not change the fixation of the tube, the discharge was left with blood on her side, her face was all dirty full of secretions, it was clear that her eyes were not cleaned ”.

After spending several days in the hospital, "the doctor informed the mother that she no longer had pneumonia and that little by little they were going to remove the sedation so that she would wake up," said Caballero. 

The next day, the family learned of Rocío's death through the condolences of an acquaintance. Upon receiving the news in this way, the stepfather went to the hospital at 6 in the morning. “When I ask him for the death certificate, Dr. Tozzeto refuses to give me the paper. He tells me that by hospital protocol he could only give me a photocopy, ”Caballero said indignantly. He explained that no one gave him explanations, and they even put two security agents at the entrance to prevent him from entering.

With the photocopy of the death certificate, the stepfather went to the Registry of Persons, where they asked him for the original certificate. The man says that he had to go four times by bus from the Registry in Posadas to the hospital in Garupá.

The family says Registry staff tried to contact the hospital and wrote a note to obtain the original documentation. It was delivered and ignored. Olga, Rocío's mother, also appeared at the hospital, since the family at one point suspected that they were not giving the certificate to Caballero because he was not the biological father of the young woman. 

The stepfather continued insisting regarding the constancy, and after the refusals of the health professionals, he asked to see the director. He got him to be attended by Dr. Jaime Brestzki, the hospital manager. Olga explained to the doctor that, as a nurse, she knows that they cannot deny their relatives a death certificate. Given this, the doctor acknowledged that they made a mistake and handed over the document.

By protocol, the family could not enter the morgue or recognize or remove the body. Caballero had to obtain a truck at the request of the hospital and resorted to calling a delegate from the Municipality of Itaembé Miní to get a drawer.

 “They gave me white gloves and with my personal mask (my own) I entered the place. They didn't want to help me load the body into the drawer. I had to carry it, put it in the drawer, they did not let me dress her, they did not clean her, I had to take her out with a hospital gown "she said and reported that when she requested help due to the weight of the body" the nurse said "since so much You insist, you do it '”, using the excuse of the“ protocol for COVID ”. 

Official notice of death
The hospital formally reported the death of the young woman at 6:00 p.m. on August 11. The record details that he died at 00.35. In other words, almost 18 hours later they notified the relatives.

“A las 18 horas se acerca un móvil de la seccional novena a la casa de mi cuñada, que vive en Itaembé Miní,  y el oficial le dice que el hospital de Fátima le había pedido que se acerquen a avisar que Rocío había fallecido, cuando nosotros ya la habíamos enterrado” expresó el padrastro. “Desde la llamada al 107 hasta el deceso de Rocío, hubo un abandono de persona, una falta de respeto y humanidad, discriminación”. 

Caballero dice que tras varios pedidos, incluso a la gobernación, hasta ahora nadie del hospital ni de Salud Pública se comunicó con la familia. La cronista tampoco obtuvo respuestas a las consultas realizadas por este medio para tener una declaración oficial sobre el caso. Ni del hospital, ni del Ministerio, ni del INADI. 

“Es nuestra segunda hija que se nos muere en salud pública” dice la familia al referirse a Rocío. El año pasado, la hija menor, un bebé, murió presuntamente ahogada estando en Neonatología. La causa por presunto homicidio a raíz de una negligencia médica está “estancada” en el Juzgado n°6 Secretaría 2. 

“I know that Rocío's life is not given back to us, but we want it to never happen again. That there are people trained to serve regardless of gender, ideology, religion, race. Let them learn to serve people as human beings, ”said the 42-year-old innkeeper. Today she and her husband were able to file the complaint in Court 7 of Posadas. They await a response from Justice. 


Rocío Ailen Samaniego 22 years old, oriunda from the city of Posadas, during his internation and later death at Fatima Hospital, with his family they were victims of constant discrimination. From the moment of the call to 107, the ambulance refuses to move it upon confirmation of its Trans condition.
In the process of internment at Fatima Hospital, he was treated by various doctors as ′′ man ", despite possessing his self-perceived identity recorded in his National Identity Document.
At the time of his death, the family was not informed of his death, who heard from third parties. Then they refused to give him the death record by sending them to the Register of Persons to carry out the process there, who send them back to the Hospital for effective delivery for being the institution to be responsible. At the time of requesting body recognition, the family was also denied and after their insistence they manage to recognize it, finding that it was in deplorable conditions, without due hygiene due to intra-hospital abandonment. They were denied clinical history at all times, a situation that remains the same until date. There were also no answers from hospital managers when they were required by the family.
From social organizations we express our concern about the refusal of the authorities of the Fatima Hospital to give due documentation to the family and due DIGNAL TREATMENT.
This is how we also express our ENERGY REPUDIO to the facts of DISCRIMINATION suffered by the family of Rocío Ailen Samaniego; for having configured the denounced, a clear violation of the provisions of the Gender Identity Act 26.743 defined in its article 1 °: ′′ Right to gender identity: Everyone has the right: a) recognition of their gender identity; b) the free development of their person according to their gender identity; c) to be treated according to their identity of gender and in particular to be identified in the instruments that accredit their identity regarding the name / s of battery, image and sex with which it is registered there ". And a violation of article 12 ° which establishes decent treatment, and above all in the protection of human rights treaties.
We urge those who have responsibility to take matters into account, to ensure that these situations are not repeated and that laws for the protection of Trans people are effectively enforced.
