"She lived in Italy, but was in Brazil since the beginning of November. She was sick and came to Brazil to do the treatment with her family. She was in Brazil well before the covid-19 exploded in Europe. In relatives we don't have because lie"

Alice was my cousin. A beautiful person with an amazing heart. She's been treating a lung infection for months. Unfortunately last weekend she got a lot worse and couldn't resist.
