"She represented a maternity for us. She was a transvestite who lived through the dictatorship, was arrested, who had many confrontations due to her own gender identity, but who also had and occupied many spaces where she never imagined having a transvestite. She was honored in Legislative Assembly, was a topic of debate in the City Council, an important figure of national activism. It is a mixture of a lot of courage and daring, but also a lot of joy, sweetness and irreverence ", defines the coordinator.

"It is the concern of all of us, who lived the hardship of three weeks ago, it is if we are not going to have a resurgence of this scenario, of having this problem again. If the research shows that there is about 14% of the population that had , if we look on the other hand, there is 85% of the population that we can still have ", he stresses.
