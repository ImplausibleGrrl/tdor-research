MIAMI — Gia Romualdo-Rodriguez traveled from New York to Miami for surgery at Xiluet, a clinic that specializes in breast enhancements, tummy tucks and Brazilian butt lifts.

But during surgery this week, her oxygen levels and heart rate plunged. Unable to save her, the surgeon called 911. Romualdo-Rodriguez was rushed to Kendall Regional Hospital, according to Miami-Dade police, but it was too late.

She died at age 46. The Miami-Dade Medical Examiner’s Office said Thursday that Romualdo-Rodriguez’s death has been ruled accidental — the result of an embolism caused by fat injected into her buttocks.

The case was the latest Brazilian butt-lift death in Miami, which draws women and men from across the country willing to risk the oft-dangerous surgery for bigger and rounder buttocks. At least 20 people have died in Florida in the past decade because of complications from the procedure, almost all of them in Miami, according to one researcher who tracks the deaths.

Fatalities involved in the popular procedure have happened so frequently that the Florida Board of Medicine last year set new restrictions for surgeons. The rule prohibits surgeons from injecting fat into or below a patient’s gluteal muscles because of the risk of piercing the gluteal vein, which can cause fat clots to travel to the heart and lungs, leading those organs to fail.

During a Brazilian butt lift, surgeons remove fat from a patient’s stomach using liposuction. The fat is treated and then grafted to the buttocks by injection. The rule adopted by the Board of Medicine requires doctors to inject the fat above the muscle and below the skin.


Gia Romualdo-Rodriguez was a transgender woman who traveled from New York to Miami to undergo buttock lift surgery at the Xiluet Plastic Surgery clinic in Miami, at a cost of $ 3,800.

According to information from the Miami Herald, the surgical procedure, popularly known as Brazilian butt-lift, was performed on Tuesday (15) by Dr. Stephanie Stover.

During the surgery, the patient's oxygen levels and heart rate showed serious changes and she had to be rushed to Kendall Regional Hospital. Where death was confirmed at age 46.

The Miami-Dade Medical Examiner's Office considered Gia's death accidental. "Result of an embolism caused by fat injected into the buttocks," reported the Herald.

Sought by journalists, the doctor who performed the procedure declined to comment on the case. However, a search for the profile of Dr. Stephanie Stover on the Florida Department of Healh website shows that she has a license to perform the procedure.

On the clinic's website, this type of surgery that consists of aspirating localized fats from other parts of the body and introducing them into the buttocks is described as "safe".  

Risks and restrictions

A report prepared by the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery’s revealed that this type of aesthetic procedure grew 61% in the USA between the years 2013 and 2018. Having been performed 25,168 times in this period - more than 18 thousand of this total in Miami- County alone Dade.  

Still in 2018, the institution issued an alert on the risks of the Brazilian butt-lift, stating that “one in 1.3 thousand people die as a result of this non-country surgical intervention”. Index considered very high by health authorities.

Following the recommendation of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, the state of Florida passed an emergency law on June 17 this year, prohibiting surgeons from injecting fat into or below the gluteal muscles. The justification is the high risk of perforation of the gluteal vein, which can cause fat clots to navigate through the bloodstream and reach the heart and lungs, causing an embolism like what happened with Gia.

If they violate the rules, the office can be closed and the medical license revoked immediately in case of injury or death of the patient.

Data collected by the Miami Herald show that the Brazilian butt-lift surgery has killed 20 people in South Florida from 2010 to date. The last case occurred in May 2019.

Gia Romualdo-Rodriguez had Mexican nationality and was in the process of transitioning to the female gender. She was also going to have breast augmentation surgery.

MIAMI.- A transsexual woman of Mexican origin who traveled from New York to Miami to undergo a "Brazilian lift" in her buttocks suffered a fat embolism during the operation and died, local media reported.

Gia Romualdo Rodríguez, 46, died last Tuesday, according to the Miami-Dade County Coroner's Office, which described the death as accidental.


As her condition worsened at the private Miami clinic where the operation was performed, Rodríguez was taken to a regional hospital, but by the time she arrived it was too late, according to Miami-Dade police.

The media point out that in the last ten years about twenty people have died in Florida during or after a "Brazilian lift" operation, which consists of placing fat that is extracted from other parts of the patient's body on the buttocks to give them volume.

Most of the deaths in Florida as a result of this operation are women and Miami is where there have been the most cases, according to an investigation by an individual cited by the media.

The Miami Herald newspaper indicated that problems with this type of operation are so frequent that the Florida Board of Medicine established new rules for surgeons last year.

Among them is the prohibition of injecting fat into or below the gluteal muscles, since doing so can puncture a vein in that area and that can cause the fat to reach the heart and lungs and cause organ failur

According to the newspaper, the deceased had recently received asylum to be able to live in the United States.
