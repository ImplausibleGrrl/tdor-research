SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico —  Soraya Santiago, the first person from Puerto Rico to undergo gender reassignment surgery and a longtime icon for the U.S. territory’s LGBTQ community, has died. She was 73.
Santiago died of cancer early Tuesday at her home in the north coastal city of Carolina, activist Pedro Julio Serrano told The Associated Press.

Many mourned the news, including the mayor of Puerto Rico’s capital and activists on the U.S. mainland.

“Soraya was a pioneer, our teacher, our beacon of light,” trans activist Ivana Fred said in a statement. “She opened the door for all us trans people and left us a legacy of unwavering spirit that is unmatched.”

Santiago had often hung out at New York’s Stonewall Inn and was in the city — though not the bar — when police raided it in 1969, unleashing a rebellion that led to the LGBTQ rights movement. She credited that with helping turn her into an activist.

She traveled again to New York in the 1970s for gender reassignment surgery and upon returning to Puerto Rico, became the island’s first trans person to successfully change their name and sex on their birth certificate.

Santiago, a hair stylist who owned a beauty shop, was the first openly trans person to run for office in Puerto Rico, according to the Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College in New York, trying unsuccessfully for a city council seat in 2008. She was also the first LGBTQ candidate to do so as a member of the pro-statehood New Progressive Party, the center said.

Santiago said in a 2019 interview with the online collaborative publishing platform United Explanations that much work remains to be done.

“Those were doors I opened, and I hope to keep opening more doors so that the community can keep establishing itself where it should be and not where people want it to be,” she was quoted as saying.

Santiago studied political science at Puerto Rico’s largest public university and was featured in several documentaries, including the 2014 Puerto Rican film “Mala, Mala,” which follows nine transgender people. Santiago also published a book, “Made by Hand: Gender Dysmorphia.”


Soraya Santiago, a trans activist, queer icon and the first person in Puerto Rico to receive gender confirmation surgery, has passed away at the age of 73.

According to the Associated Press, Santiago had been battling cancer, and died Tuesday (September 22) at her home in the city of Carolina.

She was a trailblazer in a multitude of ways. Not only was she the first known person in Puerto Rico to have had gender confirmation surgery, she was also the first on the island to successfully change her name and sex on her birth certificate, and the first openly trans person to run for office in the US territory.

In 2019, she told United Explanations: “Those were doors I opened, and I hope to keep opening more doors so that the community can keep establishing itself where it should be and not where people want it to be.”

Santiago featured in multiple documentaries, including the award-winning 2014 film Mala Mala, and wrote a book titled Made by Hand: Gender Dysmorphia. 

She graduated with a BA in political science from the University of Puerto Rico last year at the age of 72.

Carmen Yulín Cruz, the mayor of Puerto Rico’s largest city, paid tribute to Santiago on Twitter, writing: “Soraya, our heroine in the fight for the dignity of our compatriots in the trans community, died after a battle against cancer.

“We love you, we owe you a lot and we will never forget you.

“Rest my dear, but keep giving us strength from there. I will miss you.”

When Santiago was asked if she had a message for young trans people, she added in the United Explanations interview: “Although much progress has been made on all these issues of acceptance, rights and equality, there is still a long way to go.

“The youngest are already doing it, they are already walking that path. The youth of today is more open.

“But it occurs to me to tell them to follow their dreams, not to stop dreaming, that if they believe that this is their reality and the truth of their life, they should run after it and not after what society, wrongly, wants to impose on them.”
