WEIGHT NOTE

It is with great regret that ANTRA news that today, May 18, 2020, we lost an important militant and trans activist. Mariah Agatha Jeremias de Sousa Lima left us.

This activist of Ribeirão Preto founder of NGO ASGATTAS also created and led the redesignated women's movement, still so invisible in that period.

She has a life and struggle story that blend with the very story of the trans movement.

An important feature worth highlighting in Agatha Lima, "It's the fact that she did everything she wanted. If there was a person who knew how to enjoy life, even in the face of so many difficulties, it was her", Highlights Bruna Benevides secretary of Antra.

For us who make this institution is the strength and struggle of a warrior, controversial, questioner, and uncompromising woman with discrimination and prejudice with the LGBT population especially to trans people.

Agatha Lima, rest in peace !!!

We will continue in mourning, in the fight !!!
