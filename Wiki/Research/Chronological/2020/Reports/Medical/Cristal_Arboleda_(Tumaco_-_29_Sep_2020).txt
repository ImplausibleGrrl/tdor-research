Cristal Arboleda passed away, but her testimony lives on

"Who is going to tell us?" Claimed Cristal, a trans woman victim of the armed conflict in Tumaco, asking that the Truth Commission recognize that in the war the actors tore the lives of LGBT people to shreds, just because of the fact to be.

Wherever he went, Cristal always claimed the patacones on his plate. It didn't matter if there was grilled fish or chicken, the patacones were the essentials. He had grown up with them. Perhaps they reminded him of school, the tumaqueñas afternoons of his adolescence and the trips with his cousin to the Ramada to eat a patacón and a salami. This plan was also followed by the clandestine reigns in which transgender women gathered to be, in the midst of a society ravaged by armed conflict, that imposed an order that did not allow being lesbian, gay, bisexual or trans . Cristal was a victim of this prejudicial violence and her testimony was recorded in the most recent report delivered to the Truth Commission, the title of which is also her own claim: "Who is going to tell us?"("When they deny us love": a discussion about love between LGBTI people)

Cristal recognized herself as a trans woman victim of the conflict in Tumaco, but only 15 years after what she suffered could she tell it with her voice. Nor did she reduce her life to that suffering and, before being a victim, she recognized herself as a woman who loved, who led and who resisted. Those who remember her speak of her constant smile. Towards 2018, when he met in a hotel in Tumaco with the investigators from Colombia Diversa, who recorded his story, he spoke gently but precisely about how his body was torn in the middle of the war. One sentence at a time and then a pause, to cry among all the harshness of his words. ( Trans-femicides, hate and brutality)

The illegals exploited Cristal and forced her, along with seven other LGBT people, to "set the mood" for the celebration of her armed group. They took her in a private vehicle from the center of the municipal seat of Tumaco to a nightclub near the road that connects Bucheli and Chilví. The report "Who is going to tell us?" He narrates that there, after being the center of the party, all the LGBT people who had been summoned to the event were subjected to cruel sexual harassment. Cristal was raped by eight members of the armed group, they beat her and threw ants on her. L to ridicule and threats were always present. ( “If you include LGBT people, the Truth Commission will change history”)

The Spectator in video:
Then came the threatening pamphlets targeting LGBT people, and so Cristal fled to Ecuador where she survived three years thanks to the hairdresser. This logic of war shows, according to the investigation by Colombia Diversa, that LGBT people were considered inferior or beings with disposable and disposable bodies, and they were persecuted with the aim of completely excluding them from society. In the middle of his story, Cristal raised this claim: " Who is going to tell us?" and this, in turn, became the title of the document delivered to the Truth Commission . LGBT community of El Carmen de Bolívar: recognized as subject of collective reparation

Months after daring to tell aloud what he had experienced, Cristal arrived in Bogotá in March 2019 to deliver another report to the Special Jurisdiction for Peace that portrayed the violence that the LGBT population experienced in Tumaco (Nariño) and Antioquia, priority areas in cases 002 and 004. He asked that a photo be taken of him on the terrace and that the white T-shirt with a printed question mark be seen that he was wearing, perhaps demanding that the transitional peace system be able to tell its true. Tania Garibello, the only trans in Ortega (Tolima)

Later she became a candidate for the Tumaco Council. She was politically active and dreamed of fighting so that LGBT people could be without “buts”. His cousin David still remembers when both, she trans and he gay, ran away from home at times to be able to be. In their naivety, they would go to El Morro beach and back, instead of getting on the bus, they would walk for three hours while people whistled at them on the road and threw stones at them shouting "fagots." David and Cristal were not aware of the discriminatory burden of that aggression and, only years later, thanks to their activism, did they identify it.

Death came to Cristal more than a month ago due to health problems, but his testimony lives in that document that Colombia Diversa prepared and that today joins two other investigations that try to narrate what the war was for LGBT people and that they were turned over to the Truth Commission. For the first time in the world, a Commission of this nature has the explicit mandate to clarify the impact of the conflict on LGBT people, an opportunity for the Colombian State to include these people in its official history and tell us what happened to them, about what manner, by whom and for what purpose.

"Who is going to tell us?" concludes that discrimination was at the heart of the Colombian armed conflict and that LGBT people, especially in Nariño, Putumayo and southern Tolima, were subjected to persecution, harassment and systematic annulment. The violence they suffered had its own peculiarities, because it was due to prejudice. They were attacked, murdered and displaced just for the fact of loving those they loved or seeing themselves as they did. And Cristal underwent that regime when she was barely coming of age. “To the memory of Cristal, a light that laughed and resisted despite the war that marked her body. Thank you for teaching us to resist loving ”, reads the dedication of the report delivered by Colombia Diversa to the Truth Commission.

Cristal dreamed of opening her own hairdresser, “Casa de reinas”. Daughter of María Colombia and Ramón. Now his story was told in his own voice. She and the almost 30 victims who also shared their testimonies hope that the Truth Commission will dedicate a specific chapter on the situation of LGBT people in the context of the armed conflict, clarify the differentiated impact on this population and recognize them not only as victims, but also as peace builders.
