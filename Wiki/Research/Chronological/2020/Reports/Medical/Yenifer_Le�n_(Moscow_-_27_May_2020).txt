Yenifer longed to consecrate herself to the 'orisha' Yemayá when death caught her in Moscow
The Cuban, who was stranded in Russia by the pandemic, was hospitalized for almost a month, the last few days denouncing the poor conditions of the center where she was. I was afraid of discrimination for being trans, black and having HIV

Cuban Yenifer León lacked three months to fulfill her year of iyaworaje and finally become a saint. 97 days in total. Very faithful to the Yoruba beliefs and the orisha of Yemayá, she had been dressed in white from top to bottom for nine months. She used to cover herself with a turban that was neatly groomed and alternated with a long natural black wig, of which she was very proud. She couldn't go out at night or get wet with rain water. In the small apartment he had shared for the past six weeks with five other people in Moscow , he had prominently placed an altar he lovingly cared for. I dreamed of going back to Cubawith enough time to prepare the day when, after the deadline, he could consecrate himself and give “a touch to Yemayá” in a ceremony with drums and in the sea, as tradition dictates.

He was passionate about romantic music. He had customized his mobile so that when he called it it sounded In case you came back , by Pastora Soler. Sometimes she would let it ring and chanted with the music: “Every night there is a rose in bed; I have not changed a thing of place, in case you return ”. On May 28, he no longer responded. She had been hospitalized for 23 days in Moscow. The latter, in a specialized center for the treatment of tuberculosis, in a room with chipped and damp walls; with a broken window, as shown by the videos and photos that he sent to EL PAÍS. She complained about the cold. She insisted that the stay did not meet the basic health conditions.


Interior of the Rabujin hospital in Moscow. On video, the recording of Yenifer León from the room in which she was admitted.
Yenifer, 33, had come to Moscow from Cuba "on a shopping spree," as she told this newspaper on April 22. It was the second time. The previous one, a couple of years ago, brought three suitcases loaded with T-shirts, underwear and kitchenware to the island. The 120 kilos of rigor in goods that the authorities allow Cubans to take to the country. On the island, where the shortage of products increases in value, he sold the material and made a profit. He wanted to repeat the operation to which a good part of the 25,000 Cubans who enter Russia each year are dedicated, and which has become so frequent that it has illuminated an entire irregular infrastructure - housing in flats, transportation, procedures, passages - around to that business.

But the pandemic came. The closing of borders. The self-isolation regime in the Russian capital. The digital pass system to move around the city. Yenifer and thousands of other Cubans were stranded in Moscow. And he ran out of money. And the antiretroviral drugs he was taking. And the roach-filled apartment he lived in was coming down on him. I was worried. Unlike many other Cubans who come to Russia to stay - some, deceived by the mafias with the promise of a job or the commitment to cross themto Europe-, Yenifer wanted to return to the Caribbean island. He had insistently called the Cuban consulate without receiving any response, he said. I was afraid of the police, of discrimination for being trans, black and having HIV.

"I can not take anymore. On Monday I will request discharge, ”said one of the last messages from the AE Rabujin tuberculosis hospital in Moscow. "Blessings! They already did the analyzes and the plates, now to wait for results, ”said another, edged with emoticons. His favorite: the little face that sends a heart-shaped kiss.

On May 5 he began to feel bad. A journey then began through the ins and outs of the Russian health system that ends with those unanswered calls to his mobile. Yenifer was admitted to Moscow's infectious hospital number 2. It was suspected that she could be infected with coronavirus, but the tests were negative. He was diagnosed with viral pneumonia but from other causes, he then explained by phone. He was there for 23 days. She did not speak Russian and could only communicate with the Google translator, says Anna Voronkova, a volunteer who collaborates independently to help the Cuban community. “Her case exemplifies that if you don't know the language or the rules, if you don't know how to navigate the paper bureaucracy, it's as if you don't have rights. And even more so if you are a trans woman in a country like Russia, ”says Voronkova, who regrets the low collaboration of the Cuban consular authorities.in a time of need for the global health crisis. The system thus rests precariously on the shoulders of volunteers and specialized NGOs without which the most vulnerable would not have assistance.

On March 22, when she thought she was going to be discharged, she was sent to the Rabujin Hospital. He had been diagnosed with tuberculosis. She remained there for five days. When Voronkova called the center less than a week later, she was told that she had died a few hours ago. That she had two-thirds of her lungs badly damaged.

His family is still waiting for more information from the Cuban consular authorities. "We are devastated, nobody tells us anything," laments his mother, Carmen Cárdenas, by phone from Jovellanos, east of Havana. She was a single mother, she says, and although she has another daughter and is a great support, she was very close to Yenifer. She explains that she wants to repatriate the body and her belongings, but that she cannot explain if it is possible and how.

Epidemiological surveillance
Yenifer died of caseous (or tuberculous) pneumonia, according to hospital sources. A very serious pathology, they explain. The health protocol states that people who lived with it and who had close contact should now be located to test for tuberculosis and, if necessary, give drug prophylaxis against infection. But no one has tried to officially locate the Cuban environment. Neither does the consulate. The Moscow Department of Health alleges that it is not easy when a foreigner does not give a correct residence address, or is registered in a different place than where he lives. It is then when the foci of the infection evaporate from the epidemiological surveillance zone, they add.

Those responsible for the hospital, which is not badly considered for the treatment of this infectious disease, which still has a high incidence in Russia -41.2 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, in 2019-, do not comment on the case due to medical secrecy, nor the center conditions. The AE Rabujín clinic focuses on tuberculosis care for homeless people, foreigners and people without papers. The unit that Yenifer was in is also specialized in people with HIV. The hospital has been under construction for a while. The Cuban was in one of the areas still undergoing renovation.

"All the current repair work on buildings is carried out according to regulations, without violating the conditions of patients and medical personnel," says the Moscow Department of Health in a written comment. "The hospital is equipped with all the necessary medicines and diagnostic equipment," they add from its communication service.

Natalia Éismont, former medical director of the center, fired almost a year ago for loss of confidence and now a member of the Alliance of Doctors, a medical union linked to the opposition Alexéi Navalni, explains that the hospital's specialists are very competent and the drugs are pointers. , but maintains that management should be thoroughly analyzed. Your organization has reported an outbreak of covid-19 at the center among healthcare professionals.

“Unfortunately, foreign citizens with HIV seldom receive good quality medical care in Russia, where they face great legal barriers to obtaining medication,” says Anton Eremin, infectious disease medical specialist at the Moscow Regional AIDS Center and consultant. at the SPID Foundation (AIDS center, in Russian), which helped Yenifer and others in the same situation to get the urgently needed antiretrovirals. “Also, they don't know who to ask for help, they can't communicate because of the language barrier. And many fear to reveal their status because of the stigma surrounding HIV. In Yenifer's case, the stigmatization of trans peopleit also hampers quality care. Thus, without legal protection or adequate medical care, these people are hospitalized at a later stage, when treatment is more complex and less effective, "adds the specialist.

Among her list of things to do in Moscow before leaving, Yenifer had two priorities: doing a photo shoot with her friends on Red Square to unleash her passion for posing and selfies; and buy her mother a typical Russian hat. She joked that on the island there is no climate for that but that you never knew when you would need to “warm your head”. No time.
