> 
> Likewise, the treating doctor said that it was necessary to contact the woman's family so that they could make decisions about her, so Caraza Rojas did not hesitate to find them while contacting the Casa de las Muñecas Tiresias AC, who in less than two hours they managed to contact their relatives in Chiapas and Veracruz.
> 
> That said, Cienfuentes García's mother traveled from Chiapas and her brother showed up at the hospital, they both saw the woman, but said they did not want to know about her , so they signed a power of attorney to Caraza Rojas to take over. of everything.
