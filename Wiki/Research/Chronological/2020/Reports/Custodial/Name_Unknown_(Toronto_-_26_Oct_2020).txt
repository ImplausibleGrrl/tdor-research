Members of Toronto's LGBTQ community are demanding answers after a 30-year-old Black transgender woman died last week after being taken into custody under Ontario's Mental Health Act, and was misgendered by the province's police watchdog in a news release.

On Oct. 26, Ontario's Special Investigations Unit (SIU) launched an investigation into what it said was the death of a 30-year-old man in Toronto.

According to the agency, which looks into any death, serious injury or allegation of sexual assault where police were present, preliminary information suggested Toronto police arrived at an apartment on Bellamy Road in Scarborough after a 911 call was made around 7 a.m. 

"When officers arrived at an 8th floor apartment unit, they observed that a man had barricaded himself inside the unit," the SIU said in a news release. "However, the officers were able to eventually make their way inside."

The release goes on to say the "man," whose name was not released, was apprehended under Mental Health Act and taken to hospital, before "he" went into medical distress and was pronounced dead at 10:15 a.m.

Family, friends, community 'owed answers'
In a statement Tuesday, The 519, an LGBTQ advocacy organization, said it had confirmed the individual was in fact a "much loved" Black trans woman.

The organization is now demanding more details about what happened.

"Among the many questions for public officials, why has the SIU published a news release that misgenders the woman who died after being informed of this error? We refuse to wait any longer for information and answers from the [Toronto Police Service] and the SIU that account for this loss of life," the statement says.

"Those closest to this tragic loss, family and friends, are owed answers. Those in our communities are owed answers. More information is needed — and it is needed now."

The organization added it will not be publishing the woman's name at this time out of respect for family and friends who may not know the details of her death. 

"To all of you who are grieving, we extend deep and heartfelt condolences. We share your grief," the statement says. 

Steps taken to connect family to support services: police
In a news release last week Monday, Toronto police said they were called to the area for a report of a break and enter.

When officers arrived however, they found there had been no break-in. Rather, the release said, "the person was in crisis" and was taken to hospital. Life-saving measures were attempted but the individual died in hospital, police said.

In a written statement to CBC News, Toronto police spokesperson Meaghan Gray said, "This information was shared proactively with The 519 and steps were taken by 43 Division to connect the family with the support services offered by The 519."

"We know the public may still have questions about how this incident unfolded and, given the SIU investigation prohibits us from providing any further detail, we hope those answers will come as soon as possible."

The 519 told CBC News it "received confirmation from the TPS directly that the deceased was, in fact, a trans woman." It also noted the Toronto police release used gender-neutral language — something it says the SIU could and should have done too.

The 519's director of legal services Justin Khan said the agency did contact the SIU about the misgendering in its release, "however they stated that they have not made contact with the family so they are unable to amend the statement."

Special Investigations Unit spokesperson Monica Hudon told CBC News the agency was contacted by The 519 last week about the deceased's identity and that its investigation is ongoing.

"However, I'm not able to say anything further with respect to the individual's identity until we have had a chance to talk to next-of-kin," Hudon said, adding numerous efforts, including phone calls and a letter, have so far been unsuccessful. 

For Khan, that's no excuse for misgendering the deceased. 

"There's no reason why the SIU couldn't have used a gender-neutral news release if they weren't able to verify that information," Khan said.

"This is an individual who's passed away," he added. "When we talk about misgendering ... we're advocating for this individual and for their family that they be remembered and recognized as the person that they were."


#TPSWhatHappened?
The 519, along with our communities, demand answers from Toronto Police Service (TPS) and the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) in regards to the death of a Black trans woman who died in hospital after being apprehended by police under the Mental Health Act.
On October 26, 2020, The 519 became aware of the death of a member of our community while in police custody. Though neither the TPS nor the SIU has released the name of the person who died or any information related to what caused their death, we have received information that confirms that the individual involved was a much loved 30-year-old Black trans woman. Out of respect for grieving family and friends, who may or may not know of the details surrounding her death, we are not publishing her name at this time. To all of you who are grieving, we extend deep and heartfelt condolences. We share your grief.

Among the many questions for public officials, why has the SIU published a news release that misgenders the woman who died after being informed of this error? We refuse to wait any longer for information and answers from the TPS and the SIU that account for this loss of life. As an organization, The 519 will continue our commitment to holding organizations, agencies, and institutions publicly accountable – investigations and reviews must be honest and transparent to members of the public. Time and time again, members within the LGBTQ2S community, particularly BIPOC queer, trans, and two-spirit communities, are let down by the organizations that are mandated to serve and protect.

Those closest to this tragic loss, family and friends, are owed answers. Those in our communities are owed answers. More information is needed – and it is needed now.

We demand that the Toronto Police Service and the Special Investigations Unit uphold their responsibility for transparency and accountability, and provide the public with more information about the circumstances that led to the death of the 30-year-old Black trans woman who was taken to hospital by police. What happened? Silence, in the face of such loss, only serves to cause greater harm.
