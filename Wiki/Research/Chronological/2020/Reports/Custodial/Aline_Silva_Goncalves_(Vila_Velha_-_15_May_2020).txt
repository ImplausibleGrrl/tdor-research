> Judge Fernando Antonio Lira Rangel, from the 5th Court of the State, Municipal Public Treasury, Public Records, Environment and Health of Vitória, condemned the State Government to indemnify the family of detainee Leonardo Silva Gonçalves, a transgender woman whose social name was Aline, killed by beating at the Vila Velha State Prison (PEVV II), in May 2020 . However, lawyer Antônio Fernando Moreira, who is working on the case, will appeal to increase the amount of compensation for moral damages for each of the authors.
> 
> The lawyer considers the compensation "negligible" given the size of the violence suffered by the victim in prison. He explains that, in cases considered less violent, the Espírito Santo Court of Justice (TJES) has established between R$40,000 and R$50,000, but for Aline's family, R$15,000 was stipulated. The amount claimed through the action was R$ 100 thousand.
> 
> In addition to compensation for moral damages, it was established that the State must compensate the mother with 2/3 of R$ 1,175.00 until the date on which the victim would turn 25 and with 1/3 of the same amount until the date on which she would complete 76 years or until the beneficiary's death.
> 
> When the death occurred, the prison administration informed the victim's mother. However, reported lawyer Paloma Garsiglia, the body was sent to the Death Verification Service (SVO), which stated that the cause of death was natural, and not to the Legal Medical Department (DML). "If they were initially informed that she had been murdered, they should have sent the body to the DML, which is where cases of suspected violent death are taken," she explained.
> 
> In view of this, the lawyer guided the family to ask for an autopsy. After registering a police report (BO) at the Homicide and Protection of the Person (DHPP), the family members, through a report, were informed that Aline suffered brain trauma and had marks on her body. The victim was charged with murder, but was pending an appeal trial, having not had a final conviction.
> 
> In his decision, the judge stated that he understood that "the conduct adopted by the agents to verify what had happened, such as the attempt to provide assistance, are not enough to rule out the causal nexus arising from the clear failure of the State to provide security and integrity physical of the custodian".
> 
> The magistrate goes on to say that "the defense's thesis in the sense that the homicide committed by a third party has the power to break the causal link, also does not deserve to prosper, since, as already pointed out, the defendant responds, in an objective way, for the duty of custody of the inmate, having failed in that obligation".
> 
> The judge also points out that, at the time of the murder, the penal establishment had 1,400 inmates, but its structure was designed for 672, a factor that is detrimental to surveillance and adequate criminal treatment". the victim was beaten by other detainees "because, possibly, he owed a lunch box, or because he had a certain sexual orientation". attacks of some against the lives of others".
> 
> Thus, according to the court decision, it is important for the State to act, "because without the necessary care, aimed at guaranteeing the physical integrity of these prisoners, the incidence of certain acts can give rise to extreme consequences, such as the case in decomposition". In the murder in question, he points out, "the history of the case reveals that the State was not able to guarantee the integrity of the prisoner Leonardo Silva Gonçalves, a duty that was his responsibility".
> 
> Violence
> 
> In an attempt to appeal to justice, lawyer Antônio Fernando Moreira ratifies in his petition the defense that the moral damages must be R$ 100 thousand for each of the authors. He justifies this on the basis of the violence suffered by the victim, such as being forced to wash clothes for other prisoners, wearing slippers tied upside down, being deprived of food and being prevented from going out to sunbathe.
> 
> In addition, the lawyer claims that it is a "hate crime, due to Leonardo [Aline's] sexual and gender orientation, considered unworthy of living with heterosexuals and beaten / lynched to death".
> 
> Antônio Fernando Moreira narrates in his petition that the victim was killed by seven people. Among them, heterosexual inmates "dissatisfied with being in the cell with people of different sexual orientation".
> 
> The petition also states that there was "previous negotiations between everyone, including the victim, to punish the inmate who made a mistake while living inside the cell", but that "there is no indication in the reports that heterosexuals have been punished".
> 
> The document goes on to report that, "when he sold a lunch box he owed to inmate Harisson Zanetti Rocha, he was [the victim] severely punished by all the prisoners in the cell after a vote in which he defined his punishment through physical aggression".

> Relatives of detainee Leonardo Silva Gonçalves, killed in the Vila Velha State Prison (PEV II) on the night of last Friday (15), demand investigation of the case. The family's lawyer, Paloma Gasiglia, who is working on the case together with lawyer Antônio Fernando Moreira, says that there are controversies in the information regarding the cause of death. In addition, the State did not adopt the necessary procedures for the death of the detainee. 
> 
> Paloma points out that, informally, the prison administration informed Leonardo's mother that he had been murdered. However, the lawyer reports, the body was sent to the Death Verification Service (SVO), which stated that the cause of death was natural, and not to the Legal Medical Department (DML). "If they were initially informed that he had been murdered, they should have sent the body to the DML, which is where cases of suspected violent death are taken", explains Paloma. In view of this, the lawyer guided the family to ask for an autopsy.
> 
> After registering a police report at the Homicide and Protection of Person Police (DHPP), the family members, through a report, were informed that Leonardo Silva Gonçalves suffered brain trauma and had marks on his body. "Why didn't they take the usual measures, such as calling the DHPP [Homicide and Protection of Persons Police Station]? It is necessary to clarify whether there was negligence", he highlights.
> 
> Paloma reports that Leonardo Silva Gonçalves was accused of murder, but was pending an appeal trial, having not had a final conviction. "He was paying within the limits of the law for the alleged crime he committed. When the State takes away freedom, it cannot be negligent with the person's life", he points out. 
> 
> The lawyer reports that the family had not heard from the detainee for four months. Paloma informs that they were unable to register for a visit. Then, she says, visits were banned because of the coronavirus pandemic, making families hear from their family members only by phone. However, when calling, family members could not make contact and the prison unit claimed that it did not have the family's phone number so that the detainee could make contact. "How come they didn't have a phone number so he could contact the family, but they had to notify him of the death?", she asks. 
> 
> The Secretary of State for Justice (Sejus) informed, in a note, that some detainees said that Leonardo Silva Gonçalves was attacked and that this will be verified.
> 
> The militant of the National Human Rights Movement (MNDH) in Espírito Santo, Gilmar Ferreira, recalls that on April 29, detainee Ivaney Rocha was murdered by cellmate Derli de Almeida at the Maximum Security II Penitentiary, in Viana. 
> 
> "There are two very violent deaths in a short time. It had been a while since there were cases of such serious crimes in the system, with refinement of cruelty, which shows that the situation is getting worse", he warned.
