They lost the ID of the trans woman who died of coronavirus and cannot be cremated
They denounced it from the Trans Migrant Women collective. They also made strong criticism of the Penitentiary Service, accusing lack of health care. "This cannot happen anymore," they lamented.

Trans Migrant Women denounced that they cannot cremate Brisa Rafaela Dávila Rojas, the woman who died of coronavirus this Monday at the Dr. Oscar Alende Interzonal General Hospital for Acute (Higa), because the security forces lost her National Identity Document (DNI).

"The body of our companion is still lying in the morgue because the police lost her documentation and without that they cannot cremate her. It is shameful. Someone has to take charge," said Preta Naomi, one of the leaders of the Mar del Plata collective.

In statements to 0223, the member of the trans community also pointed out strong criticism of the Buenos Aires Penitentiary Service since she assured that the trans woman who died from Covid-19 suffered the "violation of all her rights" during her stay in the trans women's pavilion of the Penal Unit Nº44 of Batán.

"They denied her access to health care and left her adrift. There was total negligence on the part of the Penitentiary Service and health officials," Naomi said, and assured that the inmate's release had been requested three different times. 48 years old when she is more exposed in the context of a pandemic due to suffering from underlying diseases.

For the representative of the Trans Migrant Women, if Rojas had been referred previously to the General Interzonal Hospital for Acute People, the tragic outcome that was known in the last hours would not have occurred. 

In addition, Naomi assured that it is not the only case in which there are shortcomings in health care to the detriment of trans women within the Batán prison. "We had two other colleagues who did not die from Covid-19 but who practically took them out of the prison to die outside. It is torture. They died in handcuffs, " he warned.

The member of the group also said that in jail they do not give the "indicated medication" to the inmates. "If they give him the medicines, they give it to him at the wrong time. This cannot continue because all people have the same right to health," he considered, and anticipated: "As soon as we can solve this problem in the morgue , we will make presentations in organizations so that this does not go unpunished. "
