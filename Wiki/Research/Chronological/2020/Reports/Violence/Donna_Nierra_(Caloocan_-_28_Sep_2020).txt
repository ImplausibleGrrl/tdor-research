Transwoman Donna Nierra found lifeless and people cry for justice for her.
DONNA NIERRA CASE – People from Twitter cry for justice for transgender Donna Nierra who went missing and later on, discovered lifeless.

A lot of problems and challenges the Lesbian, Gay, Transgender and Bisexual (LGBT) community in our country have been facing. There comes bullying and discrimination from families, communities and schools. And in some cases, they get the worst treatment.

Recently reported is the passing of a trans woman named Christian Nierra or also known as Donna Nierra. Accordingly, she went somewhere on Saturday and since then, she never returned home. Only to be discovered lifeless and floating on a river in Barangay 176, Caloocan City after a couple of days.

She is just 23 years old and her family is clueless as to who could have done this to her. According to a report from ABS-CBN, her sister suspected that someone living nearby could be the suspect who also left her in such devastating state.

Upon hearing the news, many netizens appeal and cry for justice for her. This happened amid the community’s mourning for their sister Jennifer Laud. She’s a transgender woman who was found lifeless in a hotel. The suspect, an American military man, was released early due to his good conduct inside the prison and only served half of his sentence.

Di mo naman kailangan ng malaking utak para maintindihan ang plight ng trans community. Kelangan mo lang maging tao.

Metro Manila Pride shares in the grief and anger of our community, following yet another brutal murder committed against our trans sisters. 1/6

Donna Nierra was found dead in Caloocan, after being reported missing last Saturday, September 26. It hasn’t even been a month since the state denied justice for our sister Jennifer Laude. 2/6

oday, we are once again confronted with the reality: prejudice and violence against the LGBTQIA+ community disproportionately affects transgender women. 3/6

The circumstances may vary, but it is the same anti-trans rhetoric that has fueled the violence against them and other transgender women––both online and offline. 4

We demand justice for Donna Nierra. We demand that her killers be found and brought to justice. We demand that the government take steps to address this long-ignored violence against our trans sisters. 5

We call for the passage of an Anti-Discrimination Bill that recognizes the oppression and violence against the LGBTQIA+ community––one that seeks to address the injustices we continue to struggle against, as we fight for our survival. 6/6
