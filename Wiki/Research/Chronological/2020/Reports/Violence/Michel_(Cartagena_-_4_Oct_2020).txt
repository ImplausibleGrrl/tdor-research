E l murder of a member of the LGBT community in Cartagena has been the work of a dubbed subject 'Carlos', who besides being dedicated to theft and consumption of hallucinogenic substances in the area where the incident occurred, around the Plaza de Toros, its main victims of its misdeeds are transgender people.

What is known from the investigations is that 'Michel' and a friend of his arrived around the Plaza de Toros, at around 4:30 am yesterday, and there they met 'Carlos'. The friend of 'Michel' left them alone and an hour later, the police say, the body of the transgender was found with three stab wounds: two in the chest and one in the right forearm. The body lay near a sardinel and amidst disposable food products scattered on the floor.

"Carlos would dedicate himself to the theft of people and the consumption of narcotic substances, and on occasions he has stolen belongings from people of the LGBT community in that area," says the police report on the alleged murderer.

The body of 'Michel' was admitted as NN to the Forensic Medicine morgue and until yesterday afternoon had not been identified. He was wearing sky blue tight pants, white tennis shoes, and a shirt of the same color. Above it was a black bag.

The comments regarding the murder that occurred in the early hours of yesterday did not wait for those who reside near that sector of the Olympic Village.

"All that area, from the playground, the surroundings of the stadium, the sports center and the Plaza de Toros is infested with people consuming vice, taking advantage of the darkness of the sector at night." "Abandoned bullring without light, garbage can, symbol of danger." "How sad to see this news, that our God pour out his love in every heart and give strength to the family of this being."

Four victims
This year, according to the Caribbean Affirmative organization, four members of the LGBT community have been murdered in Bolívar: two have been victims of police violence, one of domestic violence and another of personal injuries.

“On average, each year we are having between 20 to 23 homicides of openly LGBT people in the region, that is, people who are murdered and whose motive for their murder is the prejudice generated by their sexual orientation or gender identity or expression. . This is very serious because it is realizing that diversity is being a cause of violence in the region, ”Wilson Castañeda, director of that organization, recently told El Universal.

According to the collective, trans women and gay men continue to be the most vulnerable people to be subjected to violence in the region; Furthermore, there is a warning that these events mostly take place in public spaces, where it would be expected that there will be more protection from the authorities.

In 2020
The Caribbean Affirmative organization ensures that in general, so far in 2020, with everything and quarantine, as of July 18, 2020, in Bolívar there have been 13 cases of violence against LGBT people, among which are counted four cases of denial of rights, four homicides, two threats, two cases of police abuse, one of domestic violence and another of personal injuries.
