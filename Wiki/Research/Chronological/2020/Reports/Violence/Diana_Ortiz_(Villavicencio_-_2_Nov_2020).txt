The Villavicencio Metropolitan Police confirmed the murder of Diana Ortiz, a transgender woman, a stylist by profession

The events apparently took place inside a house located at Calle 26 No. 15ª - 27 of the Popular neighborhood, where the body of Diana, only 45 years old, was found.

The Police reported that he had an open wound at the level of the left mammary region, apparently the product of an attack with a sharp short element, a fact that caused his death in a few minutes.

From the moment the crime was known, the authority has been conducting an investigation to clarify the facts.

In Villavicencio, the repudiation and indignation over the murder of women is growing, for which groups allege that the authorities are not complying with the protection routes.
