shot

In Akron, Ohio, Black trans man Brian Powers, a cook for a catering company who was nicknamed “Egypt,” was found dead on a sidewalk outside a church June 13. Police later said Powers was killed by a single bullet that went through both thighs, and they classified his death as a homicide, the Akron Beacon Journal reports.

Police have no leads in the case, and relatives and activists recently told the paper they fear the matter isn’t being taken seriously because of his race and gender identity.

“I would think someone, you know, would know something,” his sister Vivian Powers-Smith said. “Nobody’s saying anything. ... The police, they say they have no leads.”

Added Steve Arrington of the Akron AIDS Collaborative, who met Powers at a drop-in center for LGBTQ+ African-Americans: “I’m kind of disturbed when they say ‘Black Lives Matter.’ I say, ‘Whose lives, my life? Or just heterosexual Black people’s lives? What about my LGBTQ brothers and sisters? They’re Black. Do their lives matter?’”

Powers’s family has set up a GoFundMe page to raise reward money. Relatives also plan to hold a vigil August 29 to honor him and heighten awareness of crimes against LGBTQ+ people in general. Anyone with information about his death is asked call Akron detectives at (330) 375-2490. Callers have the option of anonymity.

AKRON, Ohio — Nearly two months after the murder of a transgender man in Akron, police still have no leads.

In mid-June, Brian Powers was found dead from a gunshot wound on the sidewalk of a church near the University of Akron.

Nearly every waking moment, Vivian Powers-Smith said she thinks back to the last time she saw her little brother the week before he died.

“He was very proud of who he was,” Powers-Smith said. “Never ashamed of who he was and I think that’s a lot.”

Brian, who sometimes went by the name Egypt, confidently sported studded sunglasses and long, colorful braids.

“For anybody of the gay or transgender community to have to step out on faith and say, ‘Okay this is who I am,’ and there’s a lot of people who don’t like that,” Powers-Smith said. “But if that’s not what you agree with, then move on. Live your life. You don’t have to hurt somebody else because you don’t agree with their life.”
