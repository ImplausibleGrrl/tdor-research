> CASE . On June 18, 2020, after playing volleyball in Andabamba, Pillco Marca district, 'Tayra', "Briana" and Taylor Acosta Basualdo went to the Friendship Park located in Amarilis, where Daniel Liberato Berrospi was waiting for them aboard a red trimobile and upon being invited to get on, the three people who were supposed to be friends got on and then went to the Plaza Mayor de Amarilis, where they bought vodka and soda.
> 
> With liquor bottles in hand, the friends agreed to go for a drink at the well-known place El Hueco, located near the Pacán estate, where the four people (Daniel, Taylor, Briana and Tayra) decided to drink, smoke and use drugs. Hours passed and as a result of the drunken state, Elguera Berrospi or also known as Briana and "Tayra" began to insult each other with profanity, a fact that made his friend Taylor decide to leave the "Hueco" to go home and leaves in the place to 'Briana', 'Tayra' and the motorcycle taxi driver Daniel.

In the 'hole', apart from Daniel who decided to stay, there were in another group William Mijael Fretel Romero “Locky”, Frans Santiago Fretel Romero “Camilo”, Yhan Lii Valenzuela Pérez “Yanli”, Erick Ángelo Tello Acosta “Erick” and a such "Juanca". They continued on their own, without imagining that meters below, "Tayra" taking advantage of her height and build strangled her friend, and then pushed her to the cequión.
> 
> The next day after 10:00 in the morning, the lifeless body of Bryan Elguera Berrospi, who was homosexual, was found in the irrigation canal and, by order of the prosecutor, was transferred to the morgue, where, when subjected to autopsy, the result revealed that Bryan Milton or Briana died from extrinsic mechanical asphyxiation due to strangulation and suffocation due to submersion, which caused severe respiratory failure. In the oral trial, the specialist explained that 'Tayra', who claimed to be a transvestite, grabbed his friend by the neck until he lost consciousness, then threw him into the irrigation canal.
> 
> The people who were gathered in the hole were called to testify in the oral trial as witnesses and they all agreed that the victim and detainee had a strong argument and the last person with whom he was seen, before being found in the cequión, was with the now arrested Josué Romero Ascanao "Tayra".
> 
> Anything else
> 
> In the oral trial, 'Tayra' denied having killed her friend, she said that when they were leaving the place she heard a sound of falling, then a voice asking for help, but she did nothing to help her get out of the irrigation channel.
