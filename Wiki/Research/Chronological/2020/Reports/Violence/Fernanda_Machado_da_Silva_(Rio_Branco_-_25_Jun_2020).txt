A transvestite identified as Fernanda Machado da Silva, 27, was beaten to death in the early hours of Thursday (25), at Rua Minas Gerais, in the Preventório neighborhood in Rio Branco. According to information from the Integrated Public Security Operations Center (Ciosp), the victim was at a point of prostitution when she was approached by two people.

To G1 , the vice president of the Association of Transvestites and Transsexuals of Acre (ATTRAC), Rubby Rodrigues, informed that she is following the case and that the victim's family has already been at IML to make the identification of the body. According to her, the association is raising more information about what happened and should comment later.

A team from the Mobile Emergency Care Service (Samu) was called, started first aid, but the transvestite died in the vehicle before being taken to the emergency room. The body was taken to the Legal Medical Institute (IML) for cadaveric procedures.

The case is being investigated by the Homicide and Personal Protection Police (DHPP). The responsible delegate, Cristiano Bastos said that there is still little information and the team is on the streets doing a survey. Still according to him, there is a possibility that it is not a homicide, but it will only give more details after the result of the cadaveric report.

MP accompanies
The Public Ministry of Acre (MP-AC) released a note, this Thursday afternoon (25), stating that it follows the case through the Victim Service Center (CAV).

In the note, Patrícia Rêgo, the CAV coordinator, stressed that Brazil is among the countries that most register homicides of transgender and transvestite people.

“The Acre MP, committed to the promotion of fundamental rights, reaffirms the constitutional principle of human dignity and informs that, through the CAV, he is following the case closely and will adopt the appropriate measures to guarantee the investigation and elucidation of the facts and the circumstances surrounding the death of the young woman, as well as guiding and supporting her family members ”, she highlights.


Although in a lot of struggle and resistance within the LGBTQIA + community during all the months of a year, even though this is considered the month of LGBT pride, the persecution and murder of the people who make up the community is still an unfair reality, especially for transsexuals and transvestites from Brazil. At dawn this Thursday, 25, (more) a transvestite did not resist after being beaten in the Acre capital.

The student Fernanda Machado da Silva, 27, was on a public street, when two subjects approached her, and then began to beat her with sticks.

Silva's murder took place on Rua Minas Gerais, located in the Preventório neighborhood in Rio Branco. 

Silva started to be beaten around 2:50 this morning. The pair approached her, accusing her of stealing a cell phone. The student denied, however, they started to beat her with pieces of wood.

The Mobile Emergency Service, SAMU, was activated. However, even though first aid procedures were initiated, the victim did not resist until she was referred to the Rio Branco Urgency and Emergency Hospital, Huerb (Emergency Room). Then, his body was referred to the Legal Medical Institute, IML, to be analyzed.

The vice president of the Association of Transvestites and Transsexuals of Acre, ATTRAC, Rubby Rodrigues, is following the progress of the case with the victim's family.

According to Rodrigues, ATTRAC is still awaiting the verification of the data and will soon comment on it. 

“Our organization and the family have already received support from the Victim Assistance Center [CAV], from the Public Ministry of the State of Acre and from the Public Defender's Office,” said Rodrigues.

Forensics are investigating the case. Even the crime scene is in isolation and analysis. However, no trace has yet been found of the murderers.

Brazil is the country that kills the most transvestites and transsexuals in the world

Although with a drop of 24% in the number of murders in 2020, and taking into account the pandemic situation in the world, Brazil still leads the ranking of murders of transvestites and transsexuals worldwide.

According to the National Association of Transvestites and Transsexuals, ANTRA, this is the first case of homicide of transsexuals and transvestites in Acre since 2019.

> The trans struggle is not just a body, it is about the right and the courage to exist. But, to exist with dignity, freedom and, above all, respect. For every transgender person murdered, not only are lives lost, dreams and hopes are also lost. Fernanda left, and took with her the desire to live fully in a more humane and conscious society, leaving behind revolt and sadness, feelings that we must transform into forces to continue with her struggle.
>
> The Conservix team wishes strength to family and friends. Fernanda Machado, present!
