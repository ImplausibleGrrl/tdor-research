This is a developing story. This post will be updated as more information becomes available. 

Tatiana Hall was one of the three Black trans women murdered in the past week, along with Brayla Stone and Merci Mack.

Very little has been reported on the murder of the 21-year-old from Irvington, New Jersey, but posts of her name have been circulating throughout Instagram and Twitter.


I'm also hearing from @ttimenetwork about the possible murder of 22 year old Tatiana Hall of Irvington, NJ. We all think this happened last week. There is nothing on the news about her as of yet using her preferred name. If there is, they are probably dead-naming her. I can only imagine what if anything is being said. There are friends and family that have left comments on her page alerting others of her death. I'm still trying to look into this but right now this is all I know. I will do my best to provide any additional updates. In the meantime.... Please help if you can by signal boosting & elevating her name, donate to her funeral fund (If & when a GoFundMe support link is set up.), donate/volunteer at Black Trans led organizations. And help hold local media accountable if they are dead-naming & misgendering of Tatiana. Please do not be complacent. Our fallen trans sisters and brothers need you. We all need you. If you are cisgender, I'm going to need you to step up! We as the transgender community cannot do this alone. We will if we have to. But seriously, step up! Stop being a part of the problem! Your silence is not only insulting; it is complacency. What are you going to do to help? #SayHerName #TatianaHall #BlackTransLivesMatter #ALLBlackLivesMatter #ABLM #TransLivesMatter #WeDemandRespect #RespectUs #StopTheShade #StopDeadnamingUs #StopKillingUs * Photo is from Tatiana Hall's FB page.


According to T Time Network, a New York City-based LGBTQ+ platform that centers on trans women of color, Tatiana’s body was found in Philadelphia and not New Jersey, where she was originally reported dead. 

“While the rest of #lgbtq was enjoying gay liberation, this is what pride was for black transwomen ...another day in the battlefield.”

People have expressed fear that part of the reason people cannot find more coverage of her death is because she was deadnamed in police reports and by local media. “Deadnaming” refers to when a trans person’s birth name is used instead of  the name they chose for themselves.
