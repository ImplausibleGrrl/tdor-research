murdered

So my birth sister, Riah, was tragically murdered yesterday. Like me, she’s also trans. The news has been misgendering her as well as other people and I want to make sure that she’s remembered in death like she was in life.

same case?

A man is dead and two teenagers have been arrested after a robbery took place in Liberty Township early Tuesday morning, officials said.

The dead body of Khalic Rova-Shaquille Milton, of Cincinnati, was found in the 6600 block of Spruce Creek Drive Tuesday morning, according to the Butler County Sheriff's Office. Investigators discovered he had died of multiple gunshot wounds. He was 25.

The release states Kaleb Marshall Tooson, 18, Tyree Jeffery Cross, 25, and a 14-year-old girl "lured" Milton to the Liberty Township area to rob him of his vehicle. Milton was shot several times during the course of the robbery.

Toosen and the minor, both of Liberty Township, were arrested and charged during the course of the investigation, the release states. Toosen was charged with murder and aggravated robbery and is currently being held at the Butler County Jail, according to court records.

The minor, whose name is being withheld due to her age, was charged with with complicity to aggravated robbery, complicity to murder and tampering with evidence. Sgt. Kimberly Peters of the Butler County Sheriff's Office confirmed that the minor is currently in custody.

A warrant is out for Cross, according to the release. Cross, of Cincinnati, is wanted on complicity to murder, complicity to aggravated robbery and unlawful sexual conduct with a minor.

“Our detectives worked tirelessly to solve this case. Let this be known, if you think you can come to Butler County and commit these heinous crimes and get away with it, you obviously are not familiar on how we do things here. You may want to educate yourself," Sheriff Richard Jones stated in the release.

Neither Toosen nor Cross have previous criminal charges filed in Butler County, according to an online search.

In Hamilton County, Cross was sentenced to eight years in prison after he pleaded guilty to aggravated robbery in 2012. Court records state Cross and three others held an Avondale man at gunpoint and robbed him of his car and other possessions.
