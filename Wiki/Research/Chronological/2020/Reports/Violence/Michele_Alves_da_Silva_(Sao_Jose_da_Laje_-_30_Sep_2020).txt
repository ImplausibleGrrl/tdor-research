A transvestite was stabbed to death in the early hours of Wednesday (30), in São José da Laje, in the Zona da Mata de Alagoas. Three men were arrested, a minor was apprehended and another man, who also participated in the crime, was not found.

According to information gathered by the city's Civil Police, the victim's registration name was Fabrício Alves da Silva, known as Fabinho.

The investigation pointed out that she was at a party with the suspects, when at one point they stole about R $ 300 from the victim. She reacted and ended up being stabbed in the neck and ribs.

The delegate of the São José da Laje and Ibateguara Police Station, Edberg Oliveira, informed the G1 report that, shortly after stealing the victim, one man and the minor had left and the other three suspects stayed at the party. The victim noticed the theft, identified the suspects and went to get satisfaction.

"The two suspects who stole the victim were gone and the three men stayed. They had a disagreement with the victim and killed her. Then they hid her corpse in a wooded area," said the deputy.

Police said the murder was unrelated to transphobia because the suspects' aim was to steal the victim.

The body of the transvestite was found this morning by residents of the region, who called the police.

The Institutes of Criminalistics (IC) and Forensic Medicine (IML) were called in to carry out the investigation and collect the body.

The three suspects were taken to the Integrated Public Security Center (Cisp) in the city, where the three adults were charged for the crime of theft, homicide and hiding a corpse. The seized minor will answer for theft and will be released.
