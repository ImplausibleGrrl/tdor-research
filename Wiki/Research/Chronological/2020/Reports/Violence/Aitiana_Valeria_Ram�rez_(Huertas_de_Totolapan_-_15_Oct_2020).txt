Search continues for 3 missing youths in Yautepec

The search continues for 3 young people who disappeared on September 20 in Yautepec, the foregoing, after their discovery today in a Totolapan cistern, which occurred last Thursday, continued.

The versions pointed out that the bodies had already been identified by their relatives, but sources from the Prosecutor's Office assure that this is false.

What the Prosecutor's Office says

According to sources from the Eastern Prosecutor's Office, the version of the finding cannot be confirmed. 

Although in social networks and some media it was already ensured that it was these three people, the studies to identify the bodies found are still continuing, so there is still no official information.

The version of which they were identified

Unofficially, today it became known on social networks, by versions of relatives, that Aitiana Valeria Ramírez "Lala", as well as Jonathan Carrillo Valdepeña and José Manuel Aguilar Velazco, were found inside the cistern, on October 15., in the Huertas de Totolapan subdivision, on the border between that municipality and the State of Mexico, around noon. One more unidentified body was also found.

The three disappeared on September 20 in Yautepec.

José Manuel Aguilar, according to relatives, went to the store that day and was no longer heard from.

"Lala" was a trans girl, employed at a bar and on the aforementioned date she left her workplace but did not return home.

At the time of her disappearance she was wearing a blue jean blouse with diamonds, jean pants and a belt of the same fabric and tone.

For his part, Jonathan Carrillo Valdepeña disappeared the same day in Yautepec.

The find

Four bodies sprayed with lime were found inside a cistern [tank] in an abandoned house, in the Huertas de Totolapan subdivision, on the local Totolapan-Nepopualco highway.

It was around noon on Thursday, when the discovery of four bodies was reported to the Morelos de Totolapan Police, but it was not until around 5:30 p.m. when the lifting of them was carried out by the experts of the East Prosecutor's Office, because the perpetrators had sprayed lime and then closed the cistern, which made Civil Protection personnel from Totolapan and Atlatlahucan come to help in the maneuvers to remove the bodies.

They are four people of the male sex, although in an advanced state of decomposition, who at first glance could not see any kind of injury.

The four bodies, after being removed from the cistern, were taken to the SEMEFO for a legal necropsy.

For the moment, DNA identification work continues.
