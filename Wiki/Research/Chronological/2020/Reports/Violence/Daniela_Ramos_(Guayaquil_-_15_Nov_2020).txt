"Unofficial versions affirm that Daniela went to the Perimetral Av area to a beauty parlor, as she usually did on weekends after leaving her work," says a statement from the Silhouette X Association. 
 
In the place, Ramos lived with other people from her community and two individuals known to her, apparently. 
 
Friends claim that Daniela was left alone with these two people, while her roommate left home. 
 
Upon returning the next morning, he found her lifeless body, with signs of having been suffocated on the mattress in her bedroom.
 
His friends claim that in addition to the murder, they took his belongings and even the money he had obtained during his work week.
 
The trans community calls on the Attorney General's Office and the National Police to investigate this case, which according to the organization could be a hate crime.

RANS WOMAN IS MURDERED ASPHIXIA WITH HER BEDROOM MATCH
Quito Trans Psycho Center and Silhouette X Association, members of the Trans Revolution National Platform, bring to the public the following.
Last fifteen of November 2020, Daniela Ramos (Diogenes Jes Jesúss), trans woman from Pedro Carbo and who worked for the Alborada sector, north of Guayaquil under domestic work, was killed.
Daniela was known to several people in the community about her work. Unofficial versions claim Daniela headed to the perimeter to make beauty fixes, to leave as usual into the weekends after leaving her work. Where he dwelled with other people in the community, two individuals seemingly known to both arrived.

Friends claim Daniela was left alone with these two people as her roommate went out to scatter. On the next morning's return her body was found lifeless, with signs of being choked with her bedroom mattress. His friendships claim that additional to the murder, those or the individual, took advantage to take his belongings and even, the money he had earned during his work week and kept in his half nylon.

We call on the authorities especially the State Attorney General's Office and the National Police to investigate the present case, which could be interpreted as a hate crime.

We also invite the new Minister of the Government Patricio Pazmi ñoo to appersonate the cases of violence and killings that we have reported throughout the present regime and whose predecessor Maria Paula Romo omitted until the last day of her degradation and impeachment. Likewise we ask the Office of the Ombudsman to monitor due process.
