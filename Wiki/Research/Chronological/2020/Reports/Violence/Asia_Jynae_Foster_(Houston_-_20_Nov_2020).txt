“It saddens and pisses us off that we’re making another post about an MGP youth taken from us by anti-trans violence. Asia was outgoing, funny, and she could put together a read that left everyone around her scrambling to pick up their jaws. We’re saving a seat next to Tracy for you, Asia. We love you,” MGP wrote on Facebook. 



Foster is at least the 38th trans person murdered in the U.S. this year. The Human Rights Campaign reported that 2020 saw the nation’s highest number of deaths since the organization began tracking these murders in 2013.The vast majority of victims, including Foster, have been women of color. Three of the murders have occurred in Texas.

A young woman was found shot to death Friday night in a west Houston road.A passerby driving home around 10:50 p.m. saw a body on the 3400 block of East Greenridge Drive near Skyline Drive and and flagged down a nearby police officer, said Detective Willis Huff of the Houston Police Department.

She was shot multiple times and left to die on a road in the darkness of the night.

Asia was a Houston native. She worked at a local business and had been involved in Job Corp. She liked racing themed video games. Her social media is filled with the ups and downs, the joys and angst of any American young twentysomething.

Community members and loved ones gathered in Houston on Sunday for a candlelight vigil to honor Asia’s life.

Asia is the 38th victim of this epidemic of transphobic violence engulfing the nation.She is the 24th Black trans person and the 21st Black trans woman murdered. She is one of 15 victims age 25 or younger. Asia is the 3rd Texan transgender woman murdered in 2020.

Rest in power, Asia. You deserved so much, many years to live and love, to embrace life and enjoy your adulthood. I am so sorry.

I probably will always think about Monica Roberts in these posts. My lens is different than hers, but I hope to channel her outrage and defiance on behalf of these victims, as well as her tenderness.

There are no leads to share at this point. We don’t know who did this or why.

She deserved better.
