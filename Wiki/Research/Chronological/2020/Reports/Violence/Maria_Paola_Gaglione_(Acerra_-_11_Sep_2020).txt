motorcycle crash

(not trans, but murdered for dating a trans man)



Maria Paola Gaglione died in Caivano (Italy) when the motorcycle she was riding was run off the road by her brother.

Maria was cis, and he was angry she was engaged to a #trans man.








The murder of a young woman at the hands of her brother caused a great commotion this weekend in Napolés, Italy , and has been described as one of the most shocking crimes that occurred in the country, especially for the motive that the subject had to commit such brutal fact.

According to a local press review, María Paola Gaglione died after her brother, Antonio Gaglione , rammed the motorcycle on which he was traveling, causing him to lose control and crash into a fence, causing him an almost immediate death.

María Paola, 18 years old, was in a relationship with a 22-year-old transsexual man. Union with which Antonio did not agree.


"I didn't want to kill anyone"
"I did not want to kill anyone, but to teach my sister a lesson and especially to the one who 'infected' her," the subject declared to the police authorities of that country, the Corriere della Sera site reported .

Not satisfied with making her lose control of the motorcycle, the subject would have refused to help his sister and, on the contrary, continued his aggression, attacking her partner with blows.

"They did not want us to be together because they said that we were two girls. But it is not true. I am not a woman. I was 15 years old when I realized that I was a man. And María Paola has always loved me as a man," said Ciro Migliore , partner of the murdered young woman.

"We wanted to get away from his family"
Ciro also said that for a long time they were singled out by María Paola's family for the relationship they had.

In an interview with Corriere della Sera, Ciro stated that "a month ago" they moved to a nearby town (in Acerra) "because we wanted to get away from their family. They have always hindered us ."

Amid the sadness and heartbreak, Ciro said: "I wish I had been there in your place, I wish I were dead and not you. María Paola was the woman of my life and I am not exaggerating. We really loved each other."

Antonio, 30 years old, could not bear the idea that his sister had a transsexual partner , because she was a transphobic and homophobic person . In addition, and according to friends and relatives, for her, María Paola did not go out with a "man" but with a "woman", therefore she described her relative as a lesbian.

Antonio Gaglione, is being investigated for homicide and private violence aggravated by homophobia.




"I did not want to kill anyone, but to teach my sister a lesson and especially the one who 'infected' her," the perpetrator told the police in a case that shocked the press in that country.

Yesterday, at the end of the day, a day deliberately spent away from the internet, I read the words that Ciro, Maria Paola's partner, dedicated to his murdered girlfriend.


'Why did God take her and not me?'


In the intentions of the murderer, it should have gone like this: Ciro was the culprit, Ciro had 'infected' Maria Paola, Ciro was the abnormal.


Ciro is a trans guy. And this country yesterday gave its worst showing that not only does it not know how to tell this simple reality - there are trans people - but also that it has no interest, no desire to learn, to listen, to apologize if necessary. This country, and its daily story, is in the hands of snooty old men who no longer understand the world but who claim to continue to tell it.


And this is not fair.

Don't tell me about the degradation of the Parco Verde di Caivano: Paola and Ciro have been victims of hatred
Let's not blame the degradation, please. For some time Ciro Migliore and Paola Gaglione had been objects of hatred and hostility for their relationship. And the accident in which Paola died in Acerra is only the extreme outcome, the culmination of this persecution. Do not bring up the murder of Fortuna, the degradation, the crime. What happened in Caivano happens everywhere, it is not a territorial crime, it is a human crime, a hate crime.

Let's not blame the degradation, please. Not this time. Ciro Migliore and Paola Gaglione , involved in the road accident in which Paola lost her life and provoked by Michele Gaglione , her brother, were the victims of an attack which is the extreme result of a persecution linked to their romantic relationship.

They were chased and sent off the road with the scooter in the further, extreme attempt to induce, through exhaustion, violence and threat, the end of a story that had lasted for three years. Because Ciro Migliore, born Cira and raised in the Parco Verde di Caivano, a municipality in the hinterland sadly known to the chronicles of the murders of the Parco Verde district, is a trans boy and for this reason, as Gaglione himself admitted to the investigators , he was not suitable for his sister. As the GIP writes, Michele "wanted a 'normal' relationship for his sister". This is exactly the point.

We do not point the finger at crime, abandonment, illegal trafficking, drug trafficking, early school leaving and the whole carousel of ancestral problems of that provincial desert. Let's not bring up news stories - such as the death of Fortuna Loffredo and Antonio Giglio - that have nothing to do with what happened last Thursday in Acerra. It would only serve to divert attention once again from the heart of the matter. The death of Paola Gaglione, for which he is charged with the crime of intentional homicide aggravated by futile reasons , whether the law recognizes it or not, is a hate crime linked to the 'emotional relationship' (as defined by the same magistrate who issued the precautionary custody order ) between Paola and Ciro.

It is not a peculiarity of Caivano and certainly not of the Parco del Verde, where, if we really have to say it all, there is no code other than that of survival. This crime, which perhaps a murder should not have been, but which was nonetheless the result of violent and dangerous behavior by Gaglione (which could have harmed other people), is not a territorial crime. We have to remind ourselves. we must repeat it as a mantra, because as long as we contextualize these facts in 'degraded territories' we will find a justification (false, however) for these drifts.

The whole family (and not even a slice of the so-called community) were against Paola and Ciro. So much so that the latter said that he had already been threatened before that evening by Michele Gaglione who had promised him: "if you don't leave my sister alone, I'll cut your head and I'll kill you". Repeated threats on the night of the girl's death, when during that nefarious chase he shouted "stop, I have to kill you!". What would he have done if Paola had not died in the accident? Would he just 'just' beat Ciro, as he was doing before noticing his sister's lifeless body? Would she let him go after that 'lesson'? Would he have convinced his sister, of age and free, to go home with him? How would it end?

I would not be here to write about it if the facts had not ended in a crime, but are we sure that the hostility would have ended? That Paola and Ciro would not have been victims of other attacks, threats, ambushes? And what would we have called them? What would we have called this hostility to a relationship experienced as 'abnormal'? Let's not contextualize, let's not do it. We would lose focus on a much more painful and profound issue that concerns respect for individual choices, personal freedom, gender violence. It is true, it happened in a province disconnected from the world where occupation, future, legality, are words that are rarely practiced. But don't dismiss it as an episode of degradation. Do it for Paola and Ciro, now that love has been taken away, only the truth remains.




Remains in prison in Poggioreale Michele Antonio Gaglione, 30 years old, brother of Maria Paola, 20 years old the girl who died in the night between Friday and Saturday in Acerra (Naples), after, according to the accusation, the man rammed the scooter on the girl was traveling with her partner. In the fall the girl hit her head against a pillar and died. The crimes alleged against Michele Gaglione are manslaughter "with the aggravating circumstance of having acted for abject or futile reasons, not sharing her sister's affective relationship" with Ciro Migliore,  a trans guy. During the two hours of interrogation he reiterated that he had no intention of killing his sister, but only to stop her and bring her home and not to have rammed the scooter. 

 "It isn't true that it was an accident." Instead, says Ciro Migliore, hospitalized in the Villa dei Fiori clinic in Acerra for injuries sustained in the fall. “He ran after me, he wanted to kill me. We met him by chance, I found him behind me ». Ciro said that a few days before the incident «Michele came to my house and wanted to cut my head off, my mother was there too, she can confirm it. He told me he was going to kill me. He told me that I should not be with his sister otherwise he would kill me ».

The victim's family did not accept the girl's relationship with a trans and had repeatedly threatened the couple and also Ciro's mother. «Paola and I had to run away together - the boy continues - to come here to Acerra to live. When they found out, her brother and father beat her. It was July 13th ». According to Ciro's mother, Rosa Buonadonna, the entire family of Maria Paola has opposed their relationship. «They wanted to kill him - he said - his brother told him 'leave Paola otherwise I'll kill you. They never wanted to, Mom never wanted to accept this relationship. But children are as they are, they must always be accepted. It takes love from mom, not like she did. "
