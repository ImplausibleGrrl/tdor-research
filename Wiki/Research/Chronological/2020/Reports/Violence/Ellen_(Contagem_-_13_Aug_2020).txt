The body of a transvestite, HDB, 53, known as "Ellen", was found on the afternoon of last Thursday, August 13, with a cut on the neck on her bed, in the house where she lived, in Bairro JK, in Count.

The victim had not been seen by his neighbors for at least two days. The fact caused concern among the residents, who met in the early afternoon and decided to break down the door of the house, which was done by a neighbor.

The man broke down the door and noticed that there was nothing untidy. It was there that he entered the house and, when he got to his room, turned on the light and came across Ellen's body, lying on the bed, on a bloodstained sheet.

The neighbor noted that there was a cut in the cut on Ellen's neck. He left the house and told the other residents, who then called the police.

According to PM Lieutenant Andréa, there is no information that the victim has been seen with anyone in the past few days or has received someone at home.
