Akhenaton Jones wanted for the murder of Dominique “Rem’mie” Fells

An arrest warrant has been issued for Akhenaton Jones, 36 for the murder of black transgender woman Dominique “Rem’mie” Fells according to CBS Philadelphia.

Fells’ family is hoping anyone who knows Jones’ whereabouts will come forward. “Turn him in! This was a gruesome death,” Fells’ aunt, Germyce Williams, told CBS Philadelphia. “How anybody could do this to another human being is just so heartless and cruel. No mother should have to go through this, and I’m speaking for my sister-in-law.”

Fells’ body was found last week on the banks of the Schuylkill River. Philadelphia Police Chief Inspector Scott Small told local station WPVI that the 27-year-old had suffered stab wounds and trauma to the head and face, and her body was found with both legs severed.

“We were always concerned about her. Whenever we saw her we’d say, ‘Listen, be careful, make sure that you’re safe, because we knew that there’s a lot of hate out there for transgender,’” Fells’ aunt told CBS Philadelphia. “We accepted her as who she identified as and we just wanted the best for her,” she added.

A GoFundMe set up by family to help with funeral expenses with a $1,000 goal has received more that $125,000.

Human rights nonprofit group New Voices has organized a march in memory of Fells, to begin at 1 p.m. on Saturday in West Philadelphia. Learn more here.
