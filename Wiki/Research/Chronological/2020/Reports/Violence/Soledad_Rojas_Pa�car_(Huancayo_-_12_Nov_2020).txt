Shisha was murdered in the Sierra del Peru: they ask that her transfemicide be investigated
Nov 19 2020

Soledad Rojas Paúcar (48), also known as Shisha, was murdered on November 12 in her “Rojas” mini-market located in block 19 of Mariscal Castilla, district of El Tambo, Huancayo, in the Sierra del Peru. They found her inside her premises stabbed in the neck and nape.

According to the first investigations, there was a previous meeting at the victim's premises and Shisha would not have shown resistance, so it is presumed that it was someone known to her. The murderer stole his savings of approximately 7 thousand soles. Neighbors point out that despite the fact that the place is close to the Municipality, there are no surveillance cameras on the streets that could have helped to find Shisha's killer.

Shisha was loved in her neighborhood, because she was a hard worker, she was integrated into her community, she used to sell mazamorras and chicha at fairs and she also participated in local festivities as a tunantera (typical dance of the region). Due to the pandemic, I have rented the premises to sell groceries.


Pressure to have the case investigated
The Diversidad Wanka LGTB collective from Huancayo organized a vigil in the Constitution Park to demand that the Police and the Prosecutor's Office not stop investigating the case as happened with another murdered trans woman, Sandy, who was killed in 2010 and ended up filing the case without finding those responsible for his death.

Presentes spoke with Belgium Ledesma, coordinator of the group, who pointed out that they held the vigil because they want to know who killed her: “ Shisha was a well-known person and they knew how vulnerable she was because she lived alone, it is very likely that they planned this crime, that is why we demand that the investigations continue, that they not be archived. "

Ange Alexine Huaroto, in charge of the Wanka Diversity Emergency Attention Network, commented to Presentes that with Shisha's family they are seeing how to influence the police to quickly raise the report to the Prosecutor's Office, and that this initiate an investigation that leads to open a judicial process to those responsible for the crime.

Obstacles to access Justice
Huaroto added that in Huancayo there is a series of violence against the LGTBIQ + population, especially against trans women, who end up being left in impunity due to obstacles to access to justice. This occurs, above all, in people living in poverty, most of the cases, because they do not have enough tools to demand justice for their families. His organization currently has two cases, one of beatings with a wrist dislocation, in which the woman was incapacitated, and a rape of a trans minor, who do not have all the state legal support they need, so they have to look for volunteer lawyers so that at least the legal process against the perpetrators begins.
