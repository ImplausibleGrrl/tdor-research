UPDATE: Since our press release this morning (below), we’ve learned that Draya McCarty of Hammond was found dead in Baton Rouge, not Amite. McCarty’s death has not yet been ruled a homicide. An investigation is ongoing. We apologize for sharing information that turned out not to be accurate. Unfortunately, we often have to rely heavily on the word of community members since law enforcement does not often share helpful information about cases involving the trans community. As it stands, no information has yet been released publicly about Draya’s death.

from Hammond.
