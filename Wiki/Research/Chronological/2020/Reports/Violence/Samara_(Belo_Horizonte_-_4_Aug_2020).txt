The bodies of a man and a transvestite were found this Tuesday morning under the Mannesmann viaduct in the Santa Margarida neighborhood, in the Barreiro region of Belo Horizonte. 

According to the first reports, the victims were said to be homeless. The man, identified only as Leonardo, and the transvestite, known as Samara, were found with gunshot wounds. Leonardo was murdered with a shot to the forehead and has a deep wound to the head.


A detail that draws attention is that the transvestite had a pet dog and the dog does not leave the side of the body, even threatening to advance in those who try to get close. 

The authorship and motivation of the crime are still unknown. No suspects have been arrested.
