Oaxaca, Oax.- After being not located, Geovanna Ángulo Ramos, 27 years old, was found lifeless and in an advanced state of putrefaction in a ravine located in Suchilquitongo, Etla.

Due to this, elements of the State Investigation Agency (AEI) are investigating the case to find the whereabouts of the person or persons responsible for the crime of homicide.

It turned out that the clothes of the deceased showed several blood marks, but the cause of death is unknown.

According to police reports, on Monday, November 30, 2020, after six in the afternoon, municipal personnel from Suchilquitongo Etla, carried out their security and surveillance tours around the community.

It was while passing through the place known as El Campamento, when the uniformed men saw that at the bottom of a ravine a person was demolished.

Due to this, the community policemen descended and realized that it was a person without vital signs, who was in an advanced state of putrefaction and had clothes with blood marks.

It was for this reason that notice was given to the State Attorney General's Office (FGE), whose staff, with the support of specialists from the Institute of Expert Services (ISP), carried out the pertinent procedures.

Later, it was confirmed that the deceased was Geovanna Ángulo Ramos, who had been as a non-localized person since last November 25.

Missing

It turned out that Geovanna Ángulo Ramos, 27, was seen for the last time on November 25, in the vicinity of San Agustín Etla, Oaxaca.

The clothes she was wearing at the time of her disappearance were: navy blue jeans, black blouse, black flat shoes and gray handbag.

Due to this, both family members, friends and organizations for Lesbian-Gay-Bisexual-Transgender (LGTB) rights shared on various social networks, a disappearance file made by the Unit for the Search for Disappeared and Unlocated Persons (DNOL).

So far, the motive for the crime is unknown, which is why the AEI carries out the corresponding investigations.

OAXACA, Oax. (apro) .- The "Rosario Castellanos" Group of Studies on Women (GESMujer) expressed its outrage at the hate crime of Geovanna AR, 27, whose body was found this Tuesday in a ravine.

After demanding that the case be investigated under the feminicide protocol, the president of GESMujer, Angélica Ayala Ortiz, pointed out the urgency of implementing investigations that lead to the sanction of violent murders based on gender orientation.

Geovanna, a trans woman, was reported missing since last November 25 in San Agustín, Etla. His body was found today in a ravine in the area "El Campamento", in Santiago Suchilquitongo.

This case, like that of 477 women and girls who have been violently murdered so far during the Alejandro Murat administration, is an outrageous example of the level of sexist violence and misogyny that persist in Oaxaca, stressed Ayala Ortiz.

It also considered that discriminatory expressions, acts of violence that materialize in hate crimes, serious human rights violations for reasons related to the sexual orientation, gender identity or expression of the victims, should be eradicated from society through of public inclusion policies that recognize the rights to sexual and gender diversity.

From her expression of being a woman, Geovanna, she said, is one more victim of the omissions and negligence of the Oaxaca General Prosecutor's Office, since she was reported as missing to the search unit for people not located, but they could not find her alive.

He highlighted that in 25% of the cases of 94 women murdered in a violent way so far this year, their corpses were abandoned in vacant lots, ravines, lonely villages, dirt roads, in the garbage dump, in clandestine graves or, as in in this case, in a dam, which represents a dehumanization of her body and, therefore, should be considered as transfemicide.
