Tallahassee
USA
shot

Tony was shot by a police officer. The Florida Police Department claimed that he was armed and pulled a gun on police and had a "bloodied knife", but this is contradicted by eyewithess accounts.

> The official police report into the fatal shooting of Back trans man Tony McDade has been thrown into doubt as new eyewitnesses accounts emerge.
>
> Tony McDade was shot and killed by an unnamed white police officer in Tallahassee, north Florida, on May 27. He died shortly afterwards in hospital, his death marking Florida‚Äôs third fatal police shooting in the last two months.
>
> Local news, which along with the Florida Police Department initially misgendered McDade, reported that he was a suspect in a fatal stabbing.
>
> Speaking at a news briefing last week, Tallahassee Police chief Lawrence Revell said that the suspect fled the scene on foot and was confronted by officers on nearby Holton Street in the Leon apartment complex.
>
> ‚ÄúOur officer called out, ‚ÄòShots fired.‚Äô He said over the radio that the suspect had pointed a gun at him. The suspect was in possession of a handgun, and a bloody knife was found at the scene of the stabbing.‚Äù
>
> However, multiple reports by local news said that McDade was unarmed and had not been warned before the officer began shooting. This is corroborated by those at the scene, who say the police never announced themselves as police before firing.
