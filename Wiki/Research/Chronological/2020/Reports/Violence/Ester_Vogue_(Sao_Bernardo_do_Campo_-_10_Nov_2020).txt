Three days before turning 34, the transvestite Ester Vogue, who was in the process of gender transition, was burnt alive in the middle of the street, in downtown São Bernardo do Campo (SP), last Sunday (8). Ester was even taken to the central emergency room of the city, with about 45% of the body burned. But this Tuesday (10), she died.

And on Wednesday (11), the day of his birthday, his body was being veiled in Carapicuíba (Greater São Paulo).

The Civil Police informed the Forum that they are investigating a 25-year-old man and a 30-year-old woman for the crime. In the police report, the account states that Ester told the emergency room that she was attacked while sleeping, around 7 am on Sunday.

Ester was linked to Casa Neon Cunha, which serves the LGBTQIA + population in São Bernardo. The organization published on its social networks a note of condolence, asking for justice in the case and that the investigations reach the murderers. In the note, the crime report states that Esther was burned after arguing with a woman who had stolen it.

O texto conta que ela era negra, pobre, vivia em situação de rua e tinha iniciado sua transição de gênero recentemente. Seu apelido antes de adotar o nome feminino era Tiago Vogue porque ela gostava muito de dançar o estilo musical, especialmente ao som da cantora Madonna.

A instituição termina sua nota dizendo: “Mais uma de nós foi vitimada e não descansaremos por ESTER e por todas as vítimas da LGBTQIA+fobia estamos em Luto”.

The Forum tried to contact Casa Neon Cunha, to obtain more details of the case, without even getting the publication of this article.
