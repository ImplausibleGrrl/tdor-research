Transgender woman murdered in Cali
Sebastián Bedoya - December 2, 2020 12:00 pm
As Johana Morena Mayor, 49, the murdered transgender woman was identified when she was outside her home in Cali.

"According to the video record, J/ohana is killed by a man on a bicycle, armed, with no one to stop her, without a policeman around, security is deteriorating," said Néstor Pérez, an activist from the LGBTI community.

The victim was a micro-entrepreneur and a recognized community leader in the Alfonso López neighborhood.

"She was a woman who developed employment in Europe, she came for a walk, apart from that she lent money, they did not lend her, she lent money, it may be a hypothesis for not paying her," added Pérez.

The authorities rejected the crime and are investigating to capture the person responsible, however, they emphasize that they are working to strengthen it to address complaints of gender violence.

"What we decided is care and prevention through the Family Police Stations, at the end of this year we are receiving new computer equipment to put in these places", assured the Secretary of Security of Cali, Carlos Rojas.
