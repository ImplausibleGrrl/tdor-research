At a time when  Leidy Padilla Daza, 41, was rendering her hairdressing services, on Saturday afternoon, she was killed by two stab wounds outside her premises in the Villa del Rosario neighborhood of Valledupar. 

According to what witnesses said, the trans woman had had, minutes before, an argument with a man that forced her to go out on the public highway and there, while she was "in a state of defenselessness", she gave her an attack with a stab weapon at the level of her abdomen and neck, leaving her seriously injured. 

The victim was transferred to a healthcare center in the city, where minutes later he lost his life.

According to the Caribbean Affirmative organization, trans women were well known in Valledupar; her brother, also gay, had been killed years ago in the municipality of La Jagua de Ibirico.  

“She worked for many years in her own hairdressing salon in the capital of El Cesar, in addition to leading HIV / AIDS prevention actions in the public space; towards part of the organization of the LGBTI march in that city and accompanied the processes of the LGBTI Matices organization, ”the organization explained in a statement.

The victim, according to Caribe Affirmativo, was "taking advantage" of the fact that his labor sector was already authorized to provide services, according to the regulations issued by the Mayor's Office in the days of the pandemic.

Also read ...
"From Caribe Affirmativo, we make a strong call to the Prosecutor General's Office to promptly investigate all cases of homicides, femicides and violence against LGBTI people," the organization requested. 

In what corresponds to Leidy, because she is a trans woman, with widely recognized leadership , the organization says that the analysis of feminicide should be taken into account and centrally as a hypothesis, as indicated by the Constitutional Court (in C -539 of 2016), in order to determine if the motivations of the person who injured her to death, were related to her gender identity.

"We request the municipal mayor's office to immediately activate the actions committed in the Development Plan to protect the lives of LGBTI people in this city, and to activate actions of pedagogy and citizen culture, aimed at promoting respect and recognition of people in reason for their sexual orientation, identity and gender expression, ”the organization said in the statement. 

With the murder of Leidy, there are already four LGBTI leaders and leaders who have been assassinated in that department so far in 2020: on February 6 and 7, young gays were assassinated in that city: José Alfredo Orozco and Yojarmis Rincon, respectively, the latter of Venezuelan nationality, and on April 9, the young university student Edwin Redondo, also known for his LGBTI activism.  

In what corresponds to the Caribbean region, the murder of Leidy is the 15th case presented so far this year, of which 12 have occurred in the context of the pandemic and the isolation measures; It is also concerned that the greatest impact of homicidal violence in the region is against women.

5 of the 15 LGBTI people who have died violently in the region so far in 2020, were trans (6 lesbians, 5 trans and 4 gays): in Barranquilla, Paloma on April 16 and Brandy Carolina on June 1, that the same day Ariadna was assassinated in Santa Marta; on June 13, Estefanía in Cartagena and, yesterday, July 11, Leidy in Valledupar.
