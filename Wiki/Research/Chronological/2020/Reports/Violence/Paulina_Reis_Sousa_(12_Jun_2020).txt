Paulina Reis Sousa was shot during an attempted robbery in Anápolis (Brazil) on 12 Jun 2020.

She was 19.


A 19-year-old transvestite, identified as [deadname] Reis Sousa was murdered on Friday night (12), victim of gunfire, in the Calixtolandia neighborhood, in the southern region of Anápolis.

According to the website “Rota Policial Anápolis”, witnesses reported that the victim suffered an attempted robbery, where the thugs asked for his cell phone and money, as the transvestite did not have it, they shot her who was inside her vehicle.

Subsequently, one of the assailants allegedly dragged her out of the vehicle and left her without vital signs on a public sector road. This Saturday morning (13), the Military Police arrested five people in a white VW GOL, allegedly involved in the crime and are at Central de Flagrantes.

One of the suspects allegedly told the authorities that he had committed the crime because, according to him, he had caught a group of transvestites, including the victim, at the time. The GIH should work on two lines of investigation of the crime, whether it would be a robbery or revenge.

A transvestite, who did not have her name or age, was killed after being robbed in the neighborhood of Calixtolândia, in Anápolis, at dawn on Saturday (13). Four criminal suspects, three men and one woman, were arrested, hours after the crime, by the Military Police (PM).

According to Lt. Cláudio Antônio Júnior, the victim was accompanied by another transvestite when they were surprised by the three suspects who were in VW Gol. Both enlisted them to hire a program, but when they entered the vehicle, the assault was announced. One of the victims managed to escape.

Still according to the lieutenant, the victim still claimed that he had nothing of value, but, even so, he was killed with several shots. After being informed of the case, patrolling began until he located the home of one of the suspects in Vila Verde. At the scene, the weapon used in the crime, a 38-caliber revolver, was found under the stove. With that, the other suspects were located.

In addition, according to the lieutenant, the vehicle used in the escape is recorded as a theft, carried out in Goiânia, last June 9th. With the exception of the woman, everyone has been through the police for trafficking and theft and their age ranges from 18 to 23 years. "With the group, the amount of R $ 500 was found, but we still cannot confirm whether this money was the victim's," says the police officer.

The group was sent to the Central de Flagrantes de Anápolis. In addition to being charged for the crime of robbery, one of the suspects will be responsible for the illegal possession of a firearm and another for receiving it, since he was in the direction of the stolen vehicle. The woman, who was not at the crime scene, was fined for personal favor and reception, as she helped hide the car used in the action.

A barbaric crime was registered at the end of the night of this Friday (12) in the Calixtolândia neighborhood in Anápolis.

A transvestite was murdered during an attempted robbery. According to what Anápolis Notícias found, the victim was identified as Paulina, a native of Maranhão and was in Anápolis less than a week ago.

She and another companion were approached by individuals who were in a white Volkswagen Gol vehicle to do a program.

Upon entering the vehicle the assault was announced, the criminals asked for the victim's cell phone, as she did not have it, shot her in the chest, the other managed to get out of the vehicle and was not shot.

The Mobile Emergency Service (SAMU) was called, but the victim was already dead.
