Between June 12 and 13, a homicide took place in Hakunila, Vantaa, in which a man born in 1994 was killed.

Police suspect a 30-year-old man was killed by a man born in 1994 with a kitchen knife. The suspected act took place in the victim's apartment. Rauno Jämsä , the director of the investigation, the crime commissioner, says that the suspected act took place during the evening or night of June 12.

Police received an alert about the incident at half past three at night. The victim was found dead in the apartment.

According to Jämsä, the people already knew each other. The quarrel between the men led to a felony.

- The other has been temperate and the dispute has escalated into violence, Jämsä says.

Jämsä does not comment in more detail on the dispute between the persons.

POLICE arrested the suspect on June 13 outside the metropolitan area. According to Jämsä, the capture went smoothly.

The suspect is in custody and is suspected of murder. According to Jämsä, he has confessed to the act.

According to JÄMSÄ , the police did not report the case earlier, because the director of investigation who was responsible for investigating the case before Jämsä had hastily forgotten to inform.

The story was corrected at 17.7. 15.10: Corrected reason why the police did not report the case earlier.

 The police “forgot” for a month about this case? If it had been almost anyone else, it probably wouldn’t have been “accidentally forgotten”.
