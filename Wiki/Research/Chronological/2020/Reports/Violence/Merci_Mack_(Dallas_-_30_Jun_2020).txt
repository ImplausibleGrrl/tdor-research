Her name was Merci Mack. She was a 22-year-old Black trans woman living in Dallas. She had a job, a car, family, and friends. Her social media posts were playful, blunt, and hopeful.

On Tuesday, the final day of Pride month, she was found dead from gunshot wounds in the parking lot of an apartment complex. It was 6:15 AM. Neighbors reported hearing gunfire around 5 AM.

The final day of Pride month, in the midst of a nationwide uprising for racial justice, a young Black trans woman loses her life to gunfire. I remember yesterday, remember looking at the Google Doodle of Marsha P. Johnson, one of the most revered Black trans women in LGBTQIA history. And I weep thinking that 50+ years later, our trans neighbors particularly our trans BIPOC sisters are still bearing the brunt of the oppression. That we are grieving 22 year olds and 17 year olds.

Merci is the 17th violent death of a transgender person in the US during 2020. Eight of those neighbors were 25 or younger, including Merci who was 22. Another young Texas trans woman was shot to death in early May.

Like so many others, Merci has been deadnamed and misgendered by law enforcement and police. You might notice its ‘not as bad’ as it has been, but if she can’t have respect in these final days after enduring so much violence – when?



A 22-year-old transgender woman was found shot to death early Tuesday morning at an apartment complex east of Oak Cliff, according to Dallas police.

A passerby found her unconscious in the complex's parking lot in the 3000 block of East Ledbetter Drive around 6:15 am Tuesday.

She was pronounced dead at the scene by the Dallas Fire Department.

Residents of the complex told officers they had heard gunshots around 5 a.m., but police said there were no records of related 911 calls at the time.

Police say the victim's legal name is Michael Richey, but they do not yet know Richey's preferred name.

So far there are no detainees for his murder. Authorities are asking anyone with information about the case to contact Detective Brian Tabor at 214-671-3605 or brian.tabor@dallascityhall.com , and to see case number 114244-2020.
