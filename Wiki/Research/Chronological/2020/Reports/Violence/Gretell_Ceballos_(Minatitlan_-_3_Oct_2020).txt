MINATITLÁN, Ver., October 3, 2020.- Rodolfo Ceballos, commonly known as Gretell, is a transsexual person who was murdered on Saturday morning in the municipality of Minatitlán. The events occurred around 7 am, on calle Emiliano Zapata in the Insurgentes Norte neighborhood.

Gretell was arriving at her home when he was intercepted by unknown subjects, who shot her with a firearm. Her body was left lying on the pavement in the streets of this city. Relatives and neighbors requested support from paramedics who could do nothing for the victim as they did not have vital signs. Experts and ministerial elements lifted the corresponding proceedings and transferred the body to the Cosoleacaque Forensic Medical Service. Authorities are investigating the motive for this murder.
