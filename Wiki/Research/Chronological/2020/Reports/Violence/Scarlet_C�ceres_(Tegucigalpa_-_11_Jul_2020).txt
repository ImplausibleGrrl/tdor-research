Luis Enrique Cáceres, known as Scarlet Cáceres, was murdered in the La Plazuela neighborhood. 

TEGUCIGALPA, HONDURAS.- An LGBT member was attacked with gunshots in the La Plazuela neighborhood and hours later he died in the Emergency Room of the Hospital Escuela de Tegucigalpa, the capital of Honduras.

The victim was a transsexual who was identified by Forensic Medicine as Luis Enrique Cáceres , but who was known to his friends and family as Scarlet Cáceres.

According to preliminary versions, Cáceres was chatting with a group of friends near "El Arbolito", when a car, a tourist type, was parked on the spot.

Seconds later, several men got out of the car and approached the victim's location to shoot him repeatedly, fleeing immediately from the area.

The young man, still alive, was taken to an ambulance of the Honduran Fire Department and taken to the highest healthcare center in the country, where his death was later reported.

For his part, Rihanna Ferrera Sánchez, director of the Association of Vulnerable Groups of Honduras, regretted the death of his partner, due to violence.

"The need that she had forced her to be on the street exercising the sex trade, since she had no financial income from a job," said Ferrera Sánchez.

According to the representatives of sexual diversity, from 2009 to date about 115 trans women have been murdered in Honduras, in addition to the fact that there is one missing.
