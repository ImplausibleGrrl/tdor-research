Provocation and mockery to a trans woman would have been the pivot for a homicide in Vespasiano, in the metropolitan region of Belo Horizonte. The information was provided by the Military Police (PM), who answered the incident.

Everything would have started on Wednesday afternoon (2), after the 22-year-old woman complained to her partner for being called "lorona" by men who worked on a construction site.

The companion then went to the construction site in the Serra Dourada neighborhood to get satisfaction. At this point, according to the police record, there was a lot of confusion and aggression against a man who was supposed to have tampered with the woman.

Later, the woman's boyfriend, who was inside a barber shop, was shot several times and taken in serious condition to the Risoleta Neves hospital in the capital. Health unit officials said the man did not resist and died.

Witnesses who saw the crime and who know the victim, said the couple had lived in a condominium in the area for about three years. Neighbors, who did not want to identify themselves, said that the couple lived well, with no history of fights and that the woman is very discreet.

"I didn't see the time of the crime, I just saw her (victim's partner) crying and screaming. After that I didn't see anything else," he said. "They said that he (victim) spoke to the construction worker who would be waiting for him to finish the job to 'get' him. But with whatsapp, everything is very fast, someone came with a gun and killed him," he added.

The report was in the couple's apartment, but no one answered the bell.

A civil police officer from the Police Station on Duty of Vespasiano said that the case has not yet been closed by the military police, and therefore did not say what the next steps in the occurrence would be. No one has been arrested so far.
