Hate crime against Britani Jaqueline in Jalisco
Britani Jaqueline's transfemicide is the third hate crime in Jalisco in less than a month.

On August 26, a new hate crime was registered in Jalisco . This is the case of Britani Jaqueline, a trans woman beaten to death by police officers from the municipality of Casimiro Castillo.

According to LGBT + organizations and local press, both the Public Prosecutor's Office and the Municipal Police made transfeminicide invisible . Both institutions avoided reporting that the victim was a trans woman . They even used their dead name and referred to Britani with masculine pronouns.

The hate crime against Britani Jaqueline occurred after municipal police from Casimiro Castillo, Jalisco, arrested her for an alleged robbery.

According to local media, Letra Fría, the municipal police did not fill out the detention protocol and beat Britani "brutally". Later, upon leaving the separations, the victim required urgent medical assistance. However, "she could not be transferred", so she died due to the beatings .

Codise AC lamented the hate crime against Britani Jaqueline in Jalisco.

Also, the aforementioned media indicated that the Jalisco Prosecutor's Office has already linked five people to the process for the hate crime against Britani Jaqueline. They are the security commissioner of the Municipality of Casimiro Castillo and four municipal policemen. All are charged with the crimes of enforced disappearance, abuse of authority and qualified homicide.

Britani Jaqueline's is the third hate crime committed in Jalisco in less than a month . On August 11, the murder of Jonathan Santos , an 18-year-old queer youth, was recorded . The student from the University of Guadalajara was shot in the head in the municipality of Zapopan. KNOW THE PROGRESS OF THE CASE OF JONATHAN SANTOS.

A week later, in Guadalajara, the transfemicide of Julie Torres occurred . The authorities located the body of the victim inside her own home with multiple stab wounds. KNOW THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A HATE CRIME.

Finally, organizations such as Codise AC  and the Unión Diversa de Jalisco spoke about the case of Britani Jaqueline . In this regard, the latter organization regretted that at first they wanted to make the case invisible by not informing that the victim was a trans woman. However, the group also recognized that the recommendations of the State Human Rights Commission have already been applied and the case is being investigated as femicide. SEE HOW THEY TRAINED THE JALISCO PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE TO ATTEND HATE CRIMES.

Unfortunately, the hate crime against Britani Jaqueline was not as widespread as others registered in Jalisco, which even provoked mobilizations. However, the most important thing is justice for the victim's family.
