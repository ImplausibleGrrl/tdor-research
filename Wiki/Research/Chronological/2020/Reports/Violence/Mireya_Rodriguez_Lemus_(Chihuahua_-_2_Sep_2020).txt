> To Union y Fuerza de Mujeres Trans Chihuahuenses ac, friends, colleagues, the chosen family of # Mireya Rodriguez Lemus:
> 
> We write to them with our broken, rabid hearts. We drafted these lines with the hope of being beaten. So we run to hug you so you know that you are not alone, that our media, privileges and creativities are for you, for your grieving, for your struggles.
> 
> We recognize in you the observation that another world is possible, that it is plausible, necessary, to embrace in sorority because together we can be and inhabit a Chihuahua in which no girl, teenager or woman has to face alone the terror of exclusion and the violence.
> 
> For Mireya, for her smile and bravery, we demand that Government of the State of Chihuahua, Attorney General of the State of Chihuahua, Fiscalía Especializada de la Mujer Chihuahua guarantee truth, justice and measures of reparation and non-repetition that include The creation of a comprehensive public policy for the recognition of the dignity and importance of children, adolescents and other trans people; a policy capable of reducing the inequalities and barriers they face in the areas of health, education, work, safety and a life free of violence and discrimination. We therefore demand that you comply with your obligations and provide trans women with the opportunities they require to develop autonomous and libertarian life projects.
> 
> The media is demanded to remove articles with which they engage in hate condemning trans women to a 35-year life expectancy; we remind them that they must ensure recognition of Mireya's identity.
> 
> To the other feminist groups and organizations in the state we invite you to join the pain and outrage that seize trans women in Chihuahua and the rest of the country. Pronounce yourself, use the political spaces you occupy to recognize this murder and the murder of # PatsyAndrea as femicide, thus ensuring the implementation of the protocols and alerts we have fought for.
> 
> We question Chihuahuan society: How many more femicides will we face to organize our rage? At what point will the screams of ′ ′ ENOUGH! "Be sound enough to tear down the foundations of a society that refuses to recognize the importance of trans people, their lives and bodies? If not now, when?
> 
> Never another # femicide anymore. Never again a Chihuahua without trans women.
> 
> Malinche Movement
