Family and friends fired Yuni Carey, the transgender model who was brutally stabbed to death by her husband in Miami.

"We do not want this to become a wake, we want to pay tribute to life even if it has died in a tragic way." Today was the actress's great debut at the Azúcar nightclub after 8 months closed due to quarantine. "She was excited, happy."

Alexis Fernández, known as “Maritrini” and owner of the club where Yuni Carey worked, says that they had been apart for months. "Coincidentally the last 3 times he came to the club with the unpleasant of the couple I told him that he could not enter, because he tried to attack someone from the public."

Today he remembers the last words he had with her. "I squeeze her from behind, I give her my regards, and I say to her: I respect your career," recalls Fernández, who says that now she feels it "like a goodbye because that was on Saturday and on Monday everything happened. "

All the tip that is collected during the vigil will be donated to his family to help with the cremation, "because in the conditions that it was, it could not be watched, it completely destroyed it."

The main suspect in her death is her own husband, Igor Arruda Souza, 28, who faces charges of second degree murder.

According to the police report, the suspect called police at 4 a.m. on Tuesday saying he had stabbed his spouse.

"I ask for respect on behalf of all transsexuals because it is a gender identity because sometimes they marginalize us, a complaint made by a woman is not taken the same."




Ygor Arrudasouza told police that he killed Yuni Carey Herrera in a meth-addled fit of jealousy this morning when she told him she found a better man. According to police Ygor ArrudaSouza called 911 this morning after stabbing his estranged wife multiple times.

When police arrived, they said Arrudasouza spontaneously mentioned that meth had screwed up his life and once again admitted to stabbing his wife. Investigators found Yuni Carey Herrera lying on the floor, covered in blood and suffering from stab wounds according to NBC Miami

She later died in her condo in the Art Plaza Tower, on 58 NE 14th St.

Arrudasouza had a recent history of violence according to Local 10.com Miami-Dade County court records show he was arrested in January on three battery charges. The case remains open and he has a trial hearing on March 8.

Miami-Dade Corrections and Rehabilitation records show Arrudasouza has an immigration hold and he was out on a felony bond when the murder happened. He is being held without bond at the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center.

Ygor Arrudasouza faces one count of second-degree murder and one count of aggravated battery for the murder of Yuni Carey Herrera.
