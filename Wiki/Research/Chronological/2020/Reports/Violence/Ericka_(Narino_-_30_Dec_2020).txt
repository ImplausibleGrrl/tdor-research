Through its Twitter account, Fundación Red Comunitaria Trans, an organization that works for the rights of the trans population in Colombia, denounced the murder of a trans woman on Friday.

The victim's name was Erika and, according to that organization, "she was beaten, stabbed in the neck and there was sexual violence . " The case was registered on December 30 in Ipiales, Nariño.

At the moment, no more details of the crime are known and the authorities have not released a part of information about the fact .

The Trans Community Network pointed out that, with this case, the number of trans people who were murdered in Colombia in 2020 increases to 32 . That organization keeps a count of these crimes and, until now, they had documented 31 throughout the country.

However, several organizations have warned that there is an underreporting and that the number of trans people killed because of their gender identity is surely higher.

In 2021, the first murder was registered . The case was registered on Saturday, January 2, when Samantha, a woman behind who worked as a stylist in Mariquita, Tolima, was attacked by armed men who were mobilizing on a motorcycle and fled the place without being identified. 

"The situation does not seem to improve," they said from the Trans Community Network at that time, while they stated: "Trans people want to live .. . not only survive. "
