murdered


In yet another incident highlighting the struggles trans people face to be treated with dignity and respect, a transgender woman was found murdered in the Southern California suburb of Brawley on July 13.

Marilyn Cazares, 22, was found dead in an abandoned building as first responders answered a fire call in the early hours of Monday morning. In the wake of what was described as a “horrific” and “hateful” killing, news reports and Cazares’s family have continued to use the name and pronouns by which she was assigned at birth. Police are investigating the incident as a homicide, although they currently have very little information about the circumstances.

According to the local news outlet KYMA-13, which misgenders her in their reporting, Cazares experienced homelessness and lived in the building where she was apparently murdered. Cazares’s aunt, Mindy Garcia, said she was loved for her charisma, describing her as brave, outspoken, and a very beautiful person.

Cazares could be seen walking “down Main Street all the time looking beautiful with her head held up high,” Garcia said. “That’s how she should be remembered.”

Cazares’ family has launched a GoFundMe page to raise money for her funeral costs, bringing in over $10,000 to date. The page, however, continues to refer to her by the name and gender that she was assigned at birth.

So far, 2020 has been one of the deadliest years on record for anti-trans violence, with at least 23 known trans people who have been found dead, including Cazares. The vast majority of the known victims are Black trans women. In a particularly violent stretch at the end of June through early July, authorities found the bodies of Bree Black, Tatiana Hall, Merci Mack, Draya McCarty, Shaki Peters and Brayla Stone.

In addition, Summer Taylor, a white nonbinary individual, was killed in Seattle on July 4 when a vehicle ran over them while they participated in the Black Femme March in solidarity with Black Lives Matter and against police brutality.

The Human Rights Campaign, which has been tracking anti-trans homicides since 2016, noted that the rate of anti-trans homicides in 2020 is already outpacing last year’s record numbers, even with six months left to go. At least 27 transgender people were killed in 2019, including Denali Berries Stuckey, Muhlaysia Booker, and Breonna “Be’Be” Hill.

In a statement, Tori Cooper, director of community engagement for HRC’s Transgender Justice Initiative, called for action to prevent even more lives from being lost. “A deadly combination of racism, toxic masculinity, misogyny and transphobia is fueling devastating violence,” Cooper said. “We must come together as a community and demand justice for those who were taken from us.”

“Until trans and gender non-conforming people, especially Black trans women, are free, none of us are free,” she added. “We cannot rest until all trans and gender non-conforming people can live our lives safely as our full selves.
