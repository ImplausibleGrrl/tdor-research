Laura Taylor was sadly taken from us in the early morning of September 3rd. She was 30 years old and shot dead during a robbery at her workplace in Yukon, Oklahoma. She was described as a true warrior, a strong two-spirit lesbian woman who was proud of her native heritage, and stood sturdily in the face of adversity. She was described as so much fun, so jovial and a free spirit. She loved to play pranks on her friends and family, and she had many friends and family that she loved. She was very passionate about her family, and loved to put smiles on their faces. She was always there for them when they needed her, and she was always forgiving. She was passionate about LGBT issues and the LGBT community, and she was present at pride parades every June. She enjoyed sports, she was competitive and had played softball for many years. When she would get hurt playing she would always push through it with a smile. She loved the Oklahoma City Thunder basketball team and frequented games. Laura was very loved by many, and she left behind a brother, her parents, her 2 nephews who she was close to, and three beloved dogs. Pray for her family and friends as they grieve and adjust to this loss.
