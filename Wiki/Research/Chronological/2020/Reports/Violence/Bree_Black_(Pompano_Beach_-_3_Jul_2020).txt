Black transgender woman murdered. The community demands answers
About 25 people gathered on Sunday afternoon in Pompano Beach to mourn the death of a black transgender woman.

Bree Black, 27, was found dead in her home with a gunshot wound Friday night, according to the Broward Police Office. The Department has not released any more information about the case.
« We want some immediate answers to what is happening and we want this investigation to be conducted with complete integrity, » said Tifanny Burks, organizer of the Black Lives Matter Alliance Broward.

Burks stood in front of the group with a small makeshift altar on the ground behind her. Some protesters lit candles placed around a framed photo of Black.

« We want to make contact with his family and friends because we don’t want this altar, this event to be the end, » said Burks.
