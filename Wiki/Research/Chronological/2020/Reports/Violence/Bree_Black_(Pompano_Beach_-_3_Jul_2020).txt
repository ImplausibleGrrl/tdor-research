Transgender woman Bree Black, 27, was found with gunshot wounds Friday night by Broward Sheriff’s Office homicide detectives. BSO deputies responding to a reported shooting located the victim at 10:18 pm on the ground at 244 N.W. 12th Street in Pompano Beach, Florida.

Pompano Beach Fire Rescue personnel responded to the scene and pronounced Bree Black deceased at approximately 10:28 p.m according to the BSO Press Release.

Local advocate Tatiana Braxton said that the BSO is being very respectful in identifying her as a transgender woman. That being said, the deceased was known to friends and on Facebook as Bree Black, but the BSO is honoring a request by the family to identify her as ‘NUK’ Cameron Breon.
