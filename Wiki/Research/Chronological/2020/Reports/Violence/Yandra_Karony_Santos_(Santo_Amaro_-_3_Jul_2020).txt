A transvestite was shot to death in the city of Santo Amaro da Purificação, in the southern part of Bahia. The crime occurred at dawn on Saturday (3).

In addition to Yandra, Danilo Santos de Jesus, the victim's brother, was also murdered.

“Sofri muito preconceito só por andar com vc, mas nunca me importei com essas pessoas de mentes fracas e preconceituosas, mas aonde vc estiver quero que saiba que vc foi uma das melhores amizades que já tive, e me perdoa por eu nunca ter te falado isso pessoalmente. Santo Amaro da Purificação perdeu a graça para mim, sempre que for nesse lugar terei o meu coração inundado pela angústia. Obg pelos conselhos, pelos papos de visão, e por ter colado comigo quando eu estava na merda… Cuida da sua família de onde vc estiver, sei que eles estão arrazados. Te amo minha parceira e enquanto eu respirar vou lembrar de vc, e no meu coração sempre haverá um vazio, pois sua amizade é insubstituível, vc é eterna nos corações de todos que a conheciam”, escreveu um amigo na página de Yandra no Facebook. // Berimbau .

“I suffered a lot of prejudice just for hanging out with you, but I never cared about these people with weak and prejudiced minds, but wherever you are I want you to know that you were one of the best friends I've ever had, and forgive me for never having told you this personally. Santo Amaro da Purificação lost its grace for me, whenever I go there I will have my heart flooded with anguish. Obg for the advice, for the chats of vision, and for having stuck with me when I was in shit ... Take care of your family wherever you are, I know they are broken. I love you my partner and while I breathe I will remember you, and in my heart there will always be a void, because your friendship is irreplaceable, you are eternal in the hearts of everyone who knew you ”, wrote Lucas Divino on his friend's Facebook page.
