Investigations into the aggression of a transsexual continue in the municipality of São Luís Gonzaga, 258 km from the capital. The OAB Maranhão Commission on Sexual Diversity and Gender says that it is following the case that can be classified as a crime of transphobia.

Two weeks ago, the transsexual Natasha Nascimento was attacked by five people while passing by BR 316 leaving a party, returning home. The victim had six broken ribs and several body fractures.

Nine people have been heard by the police, including two men and three women who are identified as the main suspects of having committed the crime. The reasons that may have led to the aggression are still being investigated.

The 29-year-old transsexual remains in the ICU breathing with the help of devices. According to the family, Natasha awaits surgery on the hip region, which according to medical information, can only be done when the clinical condition stabilizes.

The victim's mother, Delsina Nascimento, says the daughter faced challenges due to sexual orientation and fears for the safety of the family.

"I didn't want anyone to mess with him, because only I know what I'm going through, suffering seeing my son in that state wrecked by the hands of others, all broken, he can't even move," says the mother.
