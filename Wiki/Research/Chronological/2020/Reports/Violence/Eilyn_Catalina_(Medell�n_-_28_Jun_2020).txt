The Red Popular Trans, a collective of trans, non-binary and 'queer' people from Medellín, denounced the murder of a trans woman sex worker in that city.

This is Eilyn Catalina, 21, who this Sunday, according to information published in the group's account, "was stabbed to death." At the moment, no further details of the case are known.

The collective regretted that the murder of Eilyn occurred precisely this Sunday, when the International LGBT Pride Day is commemorated. "It is not the day of 'pride'. It is not a holiday, it is not a day to celebrate. They continue to kill us, they are killing us ”, the publication reads.

The Trans Community Network of Bogotá also rejected the murder. In an Instagram post, that organization wrote: “in Colombia #NosEstanMatando for being trans women, for deciding on our bodies, for building ourselves as free women. Our identity is costing us life. ”

Both organizations called on the Prosecutor's Office and the Ombudsman's Office, as well as the mayor of Medellín, Daniel Quintero, to clarify the events surrounding the murder of Eilyn.

This is the third known case of a trans woman murdered in June of this year. In the middle of the month, the Corporación Caribe Affirmativo denounced that two trans women were murdered, despite the social isolation that continues in the country due to the health emergency caused by the coronavirus.

The first case was registered in Santa Marta and the second in Barranquilla. The two occurred on June 14.
