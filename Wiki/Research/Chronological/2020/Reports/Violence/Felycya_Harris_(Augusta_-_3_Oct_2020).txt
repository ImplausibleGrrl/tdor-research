A Black transgender woman was found dead in a Georgia park on Saturday, a scenario that has played out far too many times for the trans community this year.

Felycya Harris, a 33-year-old interior decorator who also taught dance, was discovered in Meadowbrook Park in Augusta, Georgia. The modestly sized recreational area is adjacent to an elementary school of the same name, located on the southwestern outskirts of the state capital.

According to the Augusta Chronicle newspaper, Harris died as a result of gunshot wounds. Her death was ruled as a homicide by Richmond County Coroner Mark Bowen, although a motive is unknown and a suspect has yet to be identified.

Local community members claimed they are in the dark regarding the circumstances which led up to her tragic death.

“We don’t know what happened — only God knows,” friend and supporter Angela Bales told the Chronicle, one of dozens rallying in her name under “Justice for Felycya” posts on Twitter and Facebook. “We’ve got to have some sort of justice for her.”

Harris’ killing marks a grim milestone in a year that has seen yet another trans person murdered almost every single week. Even with 14 weeks still left to go, she is the 31st transgender or gender nonconforming person to lose their lives to violence in 2020, which marks the single-year record for trans homicides.

Since the Human Rights Campaign began tracking anti-trans violence four years ago, the previous deadliest year on record was 2017. During the first year of Donald Trump’s presidency, 29 trans people were killed — the majority of whom were Black women.

HRC President Alphonso David said the “epidemic of violence” against the trans community “must and can be stopped.”

“We must work to address the factors that underpin this culture of violence and openly discuss how the intersection of racism, sexism, homophobia, biphobia and transphobia work to deprive transgender and gender non-conforming people of equal access to opportunity and necessities like employment, housing, and health care,” he said in a statement.

The national LGBTQ+ advocacy group further paid tribute to Harris in its press release, calling her a young woman whose life was “full of promise.”

“Felycya... ran her own company where she enjoyed lending her eye to improve the surroundings of others, and made others feel comfortable in their own space,” the organization said. “She said she could do ‘just about anything with decorating,’ which she learned from her late grandmother.”

HRC added that friends and loved ones remember Harris most by her smile and her laugh. “Everybody is going to remember who Felycya Harris is,” they said.

Other transgender people to lose their lives in recent weeks include 29-year-old Tracy “Mia” Green, who died in a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania hospital after sustaining a gunshot wound, and 35-year-old Michellyn Ramos Vargas, who was found near a farm gate in San Germán, Puerto Rico. Ramos was the sixth transgender person killed in Puerto Rico this year, according to HRC.
