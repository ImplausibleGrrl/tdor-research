A transsexual woman has been shot and killed by her 13-year-old brother in the latest episode of violence against the transgender community in Pakistan.

Local police officer Muhammad Fahim said the woman was killed on September 10 in Swabi, a district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in northwestern Pakistan. According to Fahim, she was returning from performing at a dance party in Rawalpindi, a city south of Islamabad, when her brother, Muhammad Hammad, opened fire and killed her.

Hammad has been arrested and is being detained by the police, who have been reported saying both that Hammad claimed that he had killed his sister because he was angry with her for performing at parties, and that "the incident was not a targeted murder." The body of the victim has been taken to Bacha Khan Medical Complex, Shahmansoor and there will be an autopsy. The police have promised a full investigation into his death and have offered security guarantees to other trans women in the region.

Pakistan recognizes the "third gender", but transgender people face widespread violence. In Pakistan, transgender people are legally recognized as a third gender, but face widespread violence, abuse and discrimination. The gay sex and activity gay are illegal under Pakistani law. Earlier this year, the government offered trans people access to an existing government health insurance plan, which was introduced in 2015 to provide health cards to those who earn less than $ 2 a day, although trans people are not they will face that financial test.

But there has been an increase in violence against the trans community in recent months, with another incident in northwestern Pakistan in the same week that the dancer was killed by her brother. Gul Panra, a trans activist, was shot dead in the northwestern city of Peshawar on September 9.

She died of her injuries after being shot at point-blank range six times, while another trans woman, Chahat, was seriously injured in the incident, according to TransAction Pakistan, a group that defends the rights of trans people in the country. The Pakistan Transsexual Association said 73 members of the transgender community had been killed in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region since 2015, and that hundreds of others in different regions had been killed or victims of violence.
