LGBT + collectives and organizations dedicated to the search for disappeared persons in Jalisco exposed the negligence of the authorities in the case of Susana Silvestre.
The case of Susana Silvestre , a trans woman murdered in Jalisco , is one of the most horrifying examples of transphobia and impunity that have occurred in Mexico. Until now nothing is known about who killed Susana or why. However, the most frightening thing is the re-victimization suffered by both the young woman and her relatives after the crime .

Between the transphobia and the negligence of the authorities, Susana's body remained four months in the Jalisco Institute of Forensic Sciences without being identified . If it were not for civil society organizations, the body would have been buried with total indifference, condemning the victim's relatives to continue searching for her indefinitely and to never be certain of her whereabouts .

The crime
Susana Silvestre was a 36-year-old trans woman. On October 10, 2020, someone killed her and left her body in the municipality of Tlajomulco  in circumstances that are still unclear.

That same day, workers from the Jalisco Institute of Forensic Sciences (IJCF) came to lift Susana's body. Neighbors of the place provided the experts with information on the identity of the murdered woman. Later, the neighbors themselves notified Jaqueline, Susana's sister, about what happened.

Jaqueline Silvestre, for her part, went to the IJCF facilities to claim Susana's body. Once there, he showed the authorities photographs of his sister, described her tattoos and particular signs, and gave information about the place and circumstances in which the body was lifted. However, the response he got was surprising. According to officials, there were no women at the IJCF facilities who met these characteristics. KNOW THE STATISTICS OF HATE CRIMES IN MEXICO.

The end of the search
Susana Silvestre's sister returned to the IJCF up to three times to ask about the body of her relative. Every time he received the same answer: Susana's body was supposedly not there.

Four months passed until, on February 4, 2021 , activists from the collective Por Amor a Ellxs - which is dedicated to searching for missing persons in Jalisco - published on social networks that the IJCF was about to inhume the body of a trans woman as an Unidentified Deceased Person (PFSI) . The group described the particular characteristics of the victim and the clothes he was wearing on the day of his murder. The characteristics matched those of Susana.

Más tarde, integrantes de colectivos LGBT+ que se habían involucrado en la búsqueda de Susana Silvestre vieron la publicación y avisaron a sus familiares, quienes acudieron de nuevo a las instalaciones del IJCF. Finalmente, los familiares de Susana pudieron identificar el cuerpo de la mujer trans. En efecto: el cadáver había estado en el forense desde el 10 de octubre de 2020. Si los familiares hubieran llegado una hora tarde, el cuerpo habría sido sepultado sin ser identificado.

Transfobia
El 13 de febrero de 2021, colectivos LGBT+ y organizaciones dedicadas a la búsqueda de personas desaparecidas organizaron una rueda de prensa en el Parque Revolución de Jalisco. Allí expusieron la negligencia de las autoridades:

«Nuestra compañera Susana Silvestre estuvo a punto de ser inhumada como una persona fallecida no identificada. Eso haría que sus personas cercanas y sus familiares la hubieran tenido que seguir buscando indefinidamente. Ni el IJCF, ni el Ministerio Público —que investigan la muerte— fueron capaces de agotar los actos de investigación como se debió para dar con su identidad y regresar el cuerpo de Susana con sus familiares».

Asimismo, mencionaron que la identificación del cuerpo se dificultó debido a que las autoridades no abordaron el caso con perspectiva de género. En lugar de considerar la identidad de género de Susana, trataron el caso como si la víctima fuera un hombre.

Cifras espeluznantes
Pero quizá lo más impactante es que el caso de Susana Silvestre no es aislado. Tan solo en lo que va de 2021, ya son 35 los cuerpos de Personas Fallecidas Sin Identificar (PFSI) que son inhumados en Jalisco.

De forma cotidiana, el IJCF inhuma cadáveres sin identificar. La razón es que no tiene capacidad para almacenar tantos cuerpos de víctimas de asesinato. Este dato pone en perspectiva los niveles de violencia que existen tanto en el estado como en el país.

Sobre el tema, los colectivos LGBT+ y las organizaciones dedicadas a buscar personas desaparecidas protestaron por la negligencia y transfobia de las autoridades en el caso de Susana Silvestre. Asimismo, pidieron al Gobierno de Jalisco que deje de inhumar cuerpos de personas sin identificar. También recordaron que en Jalisco hay más de 11 700 personas desaparecidas.

«How many of the 11 700 disappeared persons in Jalisco are buried by the same State without having done what is necessary to give them identity? […] Their priority must be to identify and return people to their families, not to seal them with cement in the cemeteries. This only prolongs the tragedy of those who seek without finding.

How many of those missing people have not been identified just for being trans like Susana Silvestre?

After the death of Susana Silvestre, a trans woman, her relatives went to the Forensic Medical Service to make official identification, however, they were always denied that her remains were there. Until a few days ago, the Por Amor a Ellxs group located the body through a tattoo, just the same day that it would be buried when it was not claimed.

María del Carmen Frías García, who is a friend of Susana, pointed out that since October 10, when her body was located, they were denied that it was in the morgue.

"With photos and the marks of his body that I had of him (Susana), his sister presented them to Semefo and they told him that he was not there. He went back two or three more times, they kept saying the same thing. They continued to deny that he was there. "

It was on February 4, when her relatives found out that Susana had been in the Forensic Medical Service (Semefo) since October 10. Through genetic tests the identification of the body was carried out.

"Our outrage is why they denied it to us for so many months, if evidence was taken, photographs of their case were taken and they always denied it to us, then we feel outraged, why they had it for so long," said her friend.

Until now they know nothing of the cause of his death, nor of who took his life.

Therefore, the group Por Amor a Ellxs, as well as the Center for Justice for Peace and Development (Cepad) and others on sexual diversity spoke out this Saturday about Susana's case.

"Our partner Susana was about to be buried as an unidentified deceased person, which would make her close people and their families have had to continue searching indefinitely, since neither the IJCF, nor the Public Ministry investigating the death, they were able to exhaust the investigation acts as it should have been to find her identity and return Susana's body to her relatives, "said a member of Cepad.

> On February 13, 2021, in front of the Venustiano Carranza statue, in Parque Revolución (Rojo), independent and state groups of the LGBT + community, organized a press conference demanding a response about the incompetence of the state authorities of Jalisco before the identification of the body of 36-year-old Susana Silvestre de León.
> 
> The press conference (which was directed by Dayanna de la O. Rivadeneira Ramírez Ochoa, general director of Diversidad Tlajomulco) had the purpose of demanding the investigation of Susana's death and denouncing the irregularities in the search, identification and recognition process by the Jalisco state prosecutor's office and the Jalisco Institute of Forensic Sciences.
> 
> Susana Silvestre de León, was a 36-year-old trans woman who on October 10, 2020, was the victim of a crime of transphobia that took her life; Friends of the victim comment that the brother of the deceased appeared before the SEMEFO for recognition of the body on October 11, 2020 (one day after his disappearance) and they presented him with innumerable obstacles to carry out the search and recognition process of the corpse. The answer was conceived until February 4 of this year, when they gave notice that the body was about to be buried without being identified (highlighting that the authorities did not exhaust the established methods).
> 
> The groups that called the press conference will sign a statement, which will be presented to the state government, in order to demand various improvements to the investigation processes of missing persons, as well as awareness-raising by the authorities on diversity issues sexual and gender, and collaboration with human rights entities to handle these types of cases.
