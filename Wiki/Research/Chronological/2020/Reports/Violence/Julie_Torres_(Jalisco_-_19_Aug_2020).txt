Activists and social organizations reported the transfemicide of Sam Rosales in Puebla and that of Julie Torres in Jalisco.

In the early hours of this Thursday, the transfemicide of Sam Rosales occurred in Atlixco, Puebla . The events occurred less than 24 hours after another transfemicide: that of Julie Torres in Jalisco.

The activists Jazz Bustamante and Gloria Careaga reported both events and called for justice for the victims.

Sam's case
Sam Rosales was run over and killed. The 23-year-old trans young woman was riding on a motorcycle with a companion on the Ferrocarriles boulevard at the height of Pino Suárez street, in the Revolución neighborhood, in Atlixco, Puebla, when a vehicle began to pursue her.

LGBTphobic states
Puebla, where Sam's transfemicide occurred, and Jalisco, where Julie's was registered, are states that constantly become the scene of hate crimes against the LGBT + community.

Just last week, in Jalisco, the murder of Jonathan Santos was recorded . In the absence of an adequate protocol to deal with cases related to LGBT + people, the authorities implemented the feminicide protocol to investigate the crime against the young queer . FIND OUT THE DETAILS OF THE CASE OF JONATHAN SANTOS.

Meanwhile, a case similar to the transfemicide of Sam Rosales was registered in Puebla in July. Three mechanics chased and attacked Jeidy , a young trans woman from Tehuacán, with a firearm . Fortunately, Jeidy came out of the attack alive. KNOW THE CASE OF JEIDY, THE SURVIVOR OF A TRANSPHOBIC ATTACK IN PUEBLA.

As is clear, trans women are the most vulnerable to violence. According to the organization Letter S , in 2019 there were 117 murders of LGBT + people in the country. Of that amount, 64 of the victims; that is, 55% were trans women.

Now, the transfemicide of Julie Torres and that of Sam Rosales show that the problem is far from being solved.
