Hate crime: trans woman is found dead in her room in San Miguel

A trans woman with the initials GCP was found dead in San Miguel . As detailed by María Elsa Chavarry , administrator of the building where the victim rented a room, her body was found bound. According to the description of the scene, it would be a hate crime against the LGBTIQ + community .

The deceased was 46 years old and worked in a photocopier shop in front of the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos (UNMSM). The fact that she did not get to work set off the alarms, so her sister went looking for her without expecting to find the fateful scene.

“I am the manager of the house, they called me by phone to see if I had the keys to the room to enter because they wanted to know if I was there or not. Then the sister told me that she had seen (helped by a chair) that there was a lump inside and she took a photo of it. I told her that if she's there, suddenly she's sleeping she's dizzy, that was our assumption, "said María Elsa Chavarry.

According to those who knew her, GCP was a very responsible woman and never had problems with any tenant. So far there is no further information on the crime and the police are processing the scene.
