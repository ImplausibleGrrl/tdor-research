Francesca, killed at 66 in a reception center: an acquaintance was arrested

There is one arrested for the murder of Francesca Galatro , the 66-year-old transsexual woman killed with a stab in the chest in a reception center in Vallo della Lucania (Salerno) and found dead yesterday. It is an acquaintance of the victim, considered the main suspect in the murder: the man allegedly acted in a fit of jealousy towards the woman, who had been found with a knife stuck in her chest.

The investigations carried out by the carabinieri of the local company, led by captain Annarita D'Ambrosio, led the Vallo della Lucania prosecutor's office  to issue today the arrest against the man. The area where the body was found was placed under confiscation. The man arrested, arrested last night, allegedly confessed to the murder after a long interrogation. Francesca Galatro , originally from Buonabitacolo, had a degree in engineering and had been a teacher before facing depression, alcohol addiction and job insecurity. The woman had no family but was linked to a man with whom she was preparing the wedding.

The turning point in the investigation has reassured an entire community in the face of the risk of finding themselves with a murderer on the loose, but the shock remains for what happened. In Vallo della Lucania, where she was followed by health personnel and social workers, Francesca Galatro was well known for her great faith (she went to mass at least once a week) but also for her personal vicissitudes (economic and working difficulties) but no one could imagine a similar tragedy.



Since late afternoon today he is in custody , ordered by the prosecutor Alfonso Serretiello of the Prosecutor's Office of Vallo della Lucania (Sa), a man for the murder of the 66-year-old trans Francesca Galatro . The suspect, with a criminal record, allegedly acted out of jealousy.

The woman was found lifeless yesterday afternoon, with a knife stuck in her heart , in her room at the  shelter for the homeless , managed by the S8 Zone Plan of which the Municipality of Vallo is the leading body. The Municipality had ordered the closure due to Covid emergency and Francesca would have to leave the structure, like another ten guests (including a family), tomorrow.

Originally from Buonabitacolo, with a degree in engineering and with experience as a teacher, Francesca had looked after an elderly woman for years. Marked by severe depression , she had asked to be admitted to the center last year and was followed by a support administrator arranged by the local court.

The news shocked the community of Vallo where the woman was also known for her profound religiosity, which led her to participate in the celebration of Mass every evening.

As stated to Gaynews by Ottavia Voza , architect and trans activist, "beyond the specific aspects linked to this heinous crime, the contours of which are taking shape with the development of the investigations, what is striking once again is the marginalization experienced too often by trans women , who live the burden of loneliness and the difficulties of social integration.

Francesca was an engineer, she had to resort to the assistance of public services to overcome her material difficulties, and it is not difficult to imagine that her condition as a trans woman who lived in small southern countries could have had a decisive weight in the development of his personal history ".


Woman killed in Vallo della Lucania, the murderer confesses: the motive of jealousy appears
