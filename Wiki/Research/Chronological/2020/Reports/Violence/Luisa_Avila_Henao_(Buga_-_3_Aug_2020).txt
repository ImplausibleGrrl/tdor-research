The body, according to the authorities that handled the case, was in an advanced state of decomposition, so it has not yet been possible to establish the causes or the way in which his death occurred.

It is expected that in the next few hours the forensics of the Institute of Legal Medicine of this municipality will deliver the opinion of the case.

The young woman, well-known among the Bugueña community for her cheerful and outgoing personality, lived in the Fuenmayor neighborhood and according to what was stated by people close to her, she worked in jobs related to the care of personal image.

It is worth remembering that in February of this year a brother of his who was identified as Luis Alberto Ávila Henao was assassinated, so the authorities, if the murder was confirmed as the cause of the woman's death, would enter study whether the two events are related to each other.
