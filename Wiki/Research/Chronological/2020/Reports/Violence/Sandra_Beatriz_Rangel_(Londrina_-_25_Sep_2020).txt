A transvestite, who was not identified, was killed at dawn on Friday (25), inside a motel located on the banks of Avenida Brasília, an urban stretch of the BR-369 highway in Londrina. According to information from the Military Police, the suspect arrived at the scene driving a Fiat Palio vehicle with Borrazópolis license plates. And soon after, the transvestite was dropped off at the motel by means of an application vehicle.

Moments later, the local porter reported that he heard gunshots fired, and shortly thereafter, the boy tried to get out with the vehicle. However, he was prevented from leaving the establishment but managed to jump over the wall and flee the site. The Military Police reported that, after being shot, the transvestite was still run over by the suspect.

Teams from Siate and Samu were called in, but only confirmed the death of the transvestite. The victim's body was sent to the Legal Medical Institute (IML) of Londrina. The Military Police patrolled the region but no one was arrested. The Civil Police will investigate the crime.



A 38-year-old transvestite was shot to death at dawn on Friday (25) around 2:30 am in a motel located on rua Luiza Betti, near Ceasa, in the north of Londrina.

The perpetrator of the crime, according to the Military Police , was the man who accompanied her. The establishment's employees activated the organ after hearing gunshots fired from the suite where the two were.

However, before the agents arrived on the scene, the man tried to escape by driving a black Fiat / Palio.

As the porter refused to open the gate, the perpetrator left the vehicle and fled on foot, jumping over the motel walls.

When help came, the transvestite was dead. She was shot three times in the face and died while still in the establishment's suite.

The man has not yet been found by the military police. However, as he left the vehicle at the scene, some documents were found, enabling his identification.

The transvestite's body was forwarded to the IML (Medical-Legal Institute) of Londrina . However, as she did not carry any documents, it has not yet been officially identified. Only her initials - PNI - appear in the Fire Department report.
