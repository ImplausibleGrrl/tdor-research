Priscila Ponce Nieto: on trial, without date or gender perspective

Priscila was 33 years old and was stabbed on September 14, 2020 in Zavaleta, a neighborhood of the City of Buenos Aires. A few days later, the village organization La Garganta Poderosa published a tweet demanding justice for his death. 

Georgina Orellano, General Secretary at AMMAR (Trade Union of Sex Workers of Argentina) wrote on her Facebook: “Wake up with your cell phone bursting with messages. Again. One less trans. Again and in the most brutal way "

"" La Michu del Santa Cruz "that's how we knew her, the Santa Cruz was the hotel where she lived and she had to leave because she couldn't keep paying for her room. The Michu who stopped by Salta, who always walked with her inseparable friend Lala, has no family here, they are in Peru, her family is her friends and colleagues who today cry for her and ask for justice. He did not deserve that ending, he did not deserve so much fury and cruelty, "wrote Orellano. Priscila's sister authorized the friends to claim the body and fire her. 

The crime was investigated by the national prosecutor's office No. 30, in charge of Dr. Marcela Sánchez. 

The Criminal and Correctional Court No. 30 confirmed to Presentes that the case was brought to trial on June 25, 2021. Now who must set the date is the Oral Criminal Court No. 22. The accused is Piero Lucero Rodríguez, and the crime: aggravated homicide by cruelty.
