Islamabad [Golra Darbar Posh sector E11] 
Pakistan
shot
 

Unknown gunman opened fire and murdered #transgender #Beenish Near Golra Darbar Posh sector E11 #Islamabad today.

A transgender person was shot dead by unidentified persons in a posh locality of Islamabad Sunday morning, once again raising questions on the safety of the trans persons.

The transgender, identified as Beenish, was shot dead at the sector E-11 of the federal capital. The reasons for the killing have so far been unknown, nor a case of the incident is reported to be registered.

Transgender person are frequently subjected to torture and are been murdered on the basis of the discrimination against them. In May, a trans person was murdered in Rohtas Fort area, Jehlum. The victim, identified as Hassan alias Heerawas, was murdered and his body was thrown into a well. Rescue 1122 shifted the body to the district headquarters hospital.

A month earlier, a 15-year-old Christian transgender was gang-raped and murdered by ‘local thugs’ in Faisalabad on Saturday. While demanding justice from Shireen Mazari, activist Shaan Taseer had said that the Christian and transgender community are subjected to persecution in Pakistan. “Your [Shireen Mazari] urgent intervention is required to reassure us that Pakistan is for all,” he added.

According to reports, almost 50 members of transgender community have been killed and more than 300 have faced sexual harassment and assault during the last four years in KP alone. Moreover, gender discrimination has forced the community to indulge in prostitution – that has exposed it to the hazards of HIV AIDS.
