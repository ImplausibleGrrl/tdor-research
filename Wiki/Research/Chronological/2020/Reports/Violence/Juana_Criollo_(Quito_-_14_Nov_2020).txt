Pichincha.-  It was his brother who noticed that inside the department was the lifeless body of Juan Celio Criollo Cabascango, 51 years old, who was transsexual, so he immediately notified the National Police. 

When the uniformed officers arrived at the scene, they observed that the victim had wounds caused with a knife in the occipital region. Elements of the Dinased attended the point and carried out the removal of the corpse. The incident occurred on the afternoon of Monday, November 16, at an address in the La Roldos sector, in the city of Quito.
In the respective preliminary investigations, the agents spoke with friends of the deceased who indicated that Juan had an appointment with a friend in his apartment on the night of Thursday, November 12, and it was the last day they saw him.
Given this, through the inspection of security cameras they observed the man who entered the department, the same man who was recognized by his brother, indicating that, in 2017, that subject had verbally assaulted his family member.
The main suspect was identified as Richard Fabián J., who is being sought by the National Police to be placed under the orders of the competent authority.
