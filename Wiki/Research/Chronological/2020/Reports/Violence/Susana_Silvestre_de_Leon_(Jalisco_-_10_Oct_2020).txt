After the death of Susana Silvestre, a trans woman, her relatives went to the Forensic Medical Service to make official identification, however, they were always denied that her remains were there. Until a few days ago, the Por Amor a Ellxs group located the body through a tattoo, just the same day that it would be buried when it was not claimed.

María del Carmen Frías García, who is a friend of Susana, pointed out that since October 10, when her body was located, they were denied that it was in the morgue.

"With photos and the marks of his body that I had of him (Susana), his sister presented them to Semefo and they told him that he was not there. He went back two or three more times, they kept saying the same thing. They continued to deny that he was there. "

It was on February 4, when her relatives found out that Susana had been in the Forensic Medical Service (Semefo) since October 10. Through genetic tests the identification of the body was carried out.

"Our outrage is why they denied it to us for so many months, if evidence was taken, photographs of their case were taken and they always denied it to us, then we feel outraged, why they had it for so long," said her friend.

Until now they know nothing of the cause of his death, nor of who took his life.

Therefore, the group Por Amor a Ellxs, as well as the Center for Justice for Peace and Development (Cepad) and others on sexual diversity spoke out this Saturday about Susana's case.

"Our partner Susana was about to be buried as an unidentified deceased person, which would make her close people and their families have had to continue searching indefinitely, since neither the IJCF, nor the Public Ministry investigating the death, they were able to exhaust the investigation acts as it should have been to find her identity and return Susana's body to her relatives, "said a member of Cepad.

For more than three months, the body of Susana Silvestre León, a 36-year-old trans young man, remained in the Jalisciense Institute of Forensic Sciences (IJCF), although the authorities of the organization denied having it , despite the evidence they presented and the questions that her relatives did for her.

Susana's body was handed over to her loved ones until February 4 . If not for pressure from groups and families, his remains would be forgotten, without identification, underground.

Relatives of the disappeared warn: they will continue to sit until they see demands fulfilled
“Our partner Susana was about to be buried as an unidentified deceased person . Which would mean that close people and their relatives would have had to continue searching indefinitely, ”says one of his relatives.

The groups of missing persons and LGBTQ + demanded that the authorities work on the identification and not just bury the human remains . Only so far this year 35 people whose identity is unknown have been buried.

> On February 13, 2021, in front of the Venustiano Carranza statue, in Parque Revolución (Rojo), independent and state groups of the LGBT + community, organized a press conference demanding a response about the incompetence of the state authorities of Jalisco before the identification of the body of 36-year-old Susana Silvestre de León.

The press conference (which was directed by Dayanna de la O. Rivadeneira Ramírez Ochoa, general director of Diversidad Tlajomulco) had the purpose of demanding the investigation of Susana's death and denouncing the irregularities in the search, identification and recognition process by the Jalisco state prosecutor's office and the Jalisco Institute of Forensic Sciences.

Susana Silvestre de León, was a 36-year-old trans woman who on October 10, 2020, was the victim of a crime of transphobia that took her life; Friends of the victim comment that the brother of the deceased appeared before the SEMEFO for recognition of the body on October 11, 2020 (one day after his disappearance) and they presented him with innumerable obstacles to carry out the search and recognition process of the corpse. The answer was conceived until February 4 of this year, when they gave notice that the body was about to be buried without being identified (highlighting that the authorities did not exhaust the established methods).

The groups that called the press conference will sign a statement, which will be presented to the state government, in order to demand various improvements to the investigation processes of missing persons, as well as awareness-raising by the authorities on diversity issues sexual and gender, and collaboration with human rights entities to handle these types of cases.
