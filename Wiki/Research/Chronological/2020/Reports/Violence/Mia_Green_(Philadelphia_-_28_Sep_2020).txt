Mia Green, a Black transgender woman was murdered yesterday morning by Abdullah Ibn Elamin Jaamia. The family has been notified. He is charged and in custody. For all of the folks that see this I want to make sure that it is very clear this young lady was not murdered by someone who did not know her or by someone who did not know that she was transgender. She was murdered by someone that she had a long intimate relationship with which is more often than not the case! STOP BLAMING TRANS PEOPLE FOR THEIR OWN MURDERS!
Rest well Mia.
