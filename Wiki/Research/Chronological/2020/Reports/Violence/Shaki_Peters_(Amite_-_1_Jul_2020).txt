AMITE - The St. Helena Parish Sheriff's Office said a body was found and is being investigated as a homicide. 

The sheriff's office identified the victim as Joseph Peters, 32.  Although, transgender advocates said Saturday, Peters was transgender and went by Shaki. 

Peters' body was found around 2 p.m. Wednesday on Opal Bennett Road near Amite.

Authorities also said, "There is a person of interest from another parish that is currently being investigated" but did not release any additional information.

Saturday morning, advocates for transgender rights reported Peters was misidentified by the sheriff's office and revealed a second transgender woman, Draya McCarty of Hammond, had also been found murdered in the same area near Amite this week.

Law enforcement did not confirm the second death investigation.
