Marcinha Shokenna Bastos da Silva was beaten in Maricá, Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) on 14 Jun 2020.

She was 28.


The body of a transsexual was found with blows on the afternoon of this Sunday, 14, in the neighborhood of Amizade.

The case took place at R. Mayor Joaquim Mendes, near a supermarket.

According to information, a resident found the body of the transsexual in his backyard. At the same time, he called the police.

The crime may have been motivated by transphobia, that is, a crime motivated by hatred against transgender people.

Agents from the Homicide Division of Niterói and São Gonçalo (DHNSG) were called to the scene, and carried out the expert procedures.

The victim's body, identified as Marcinha Shokenna Bastos da Silva, 28, was removed by the State Civil Defense Ministry and forwarded to the Barreto Legal Medical Institute (IML), in Niterói.

Several people demonstrated on social media, lamenting Marcinha's death.

One of them commented indignantly:

"Cowardice with my friend. I saw him grow up and become a wonderful person. What a ruin my God ”Another friend commented:

“The pain of loss and very sad is painful !! We are not prepared
to lose anyone.

"Rest in peace !! Forever in our hearts!! I will always remember you smiling and playing games! Brilhaaaaaaaaa there in the sky our little star !!! ”
