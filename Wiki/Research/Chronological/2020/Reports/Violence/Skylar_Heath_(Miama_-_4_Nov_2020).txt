Houston’s trans community is mourning the death of Asia Jynaé Foster, the latest victim in a wave of transphobic violence sweeping across the US this year.
The 22-year-old Black trans woman was shot dead in Houston, Texas on 20 November, otherwise known as the Trans Day of Remembrance – a day to honour and mourn the many trans and non-binary people who have been killed.

According to investigators, Asia’s body was found by a man walking near Skyline Drive in southwest Houston, an area friends said was close to her home.

Police believe her body was dumped after being shot multiple times, but the circumstances leading to her death remain unclear.

“Asia was outgoing, funny, and she could put together a read that left everyone around her scrambling to pick up their jaws,” said Montrose Grace Place, an LGBTQ-affirming shelter for homeless youth in Houston.

The centre held a candlelight vigil for Asia [Jynaé Foster], where friends and family said she was a beacon of light in their community.

The Human Rights Campaign believes [Asia Jynaé Foster's] death was followed by that of another trans woman, Skylar Heath, a 20-year-old Black transgender woman who was fatally shot in Miami, Florida. The murder has not yet been reported by local media and investigations are still ongoing.
