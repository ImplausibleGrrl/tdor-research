Canindé de São Francisco
Sergipe
Brazil
punched and fell



Claudia Leite was 26 years old, a transsexual, lived in the municipality of Canindé de São Francisco and, like many other transgender people in Brazil, had a dream: to be able to live in peace. However, at dawn last Thursday, the 20th, her name ended up in the ranking that anguishes and despairs several LGBTQIA + citizens in the country: that of violence against the public.

Relatives of the young woman told the police that she had recently ended a relationship and, after she disappeared, decided to file a police report. The agents started searching for the main suspect, her ex-partner, identified as Marques José dos Santos, 19 years old. He was located and confessed to killing the young woman.

According to information from the Civil Police, “Gaspar”, as he is known, said that, after the end, he would have arranged a meeting with her, in a location known as Beira Rio, claiming that they needed to talk. But when they arrived at the location, unhappy with the end of the relationship, he ended up arguing with the young woman.

Also according to his testimony, during the fight, the suspect punched the transsexual in the face who ended up unbalanced and fell from a height of approximately six meters. Still according to information from the suspect, the young woman could not resist the impact of the fall and died.

After that, he also confessed that he dragged the victim and threw her into the São Francisco River, leaving her to be carried by the current. Her body is still missing.

The Civil Police explained that the search continues and an inquiry has already been launched.
