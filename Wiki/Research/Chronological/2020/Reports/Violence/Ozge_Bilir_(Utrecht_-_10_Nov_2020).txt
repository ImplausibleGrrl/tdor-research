> Utrechter gets eight years in prison and TBS for killing a transgender girlfriend in Leidsche Rijn

> UTRECHT - 25-year-old Ilias A. from Utrecht has been sentenced to eight years in prison and tbs with compulsory treatment. Last November he stabbed his girlfriend with a knife during an argument in her apartment in Leidsche Rijn. The woman died of her injuries. The penalty is equal to the requirement of the Public Prosecution Service .
> The 25-year-old victim Özge Bilir was well-known within the transgender world. She was transgender herself and via social media she reported a lot about her transition. Her violent death sparked many sad and bewildered reactions.
> 
> The woman lived at Jan Wolkerssingel. She lived there in a sheltered housing. In the evening of November 10, she got into an argument with her friend Ilias A. He stated that he went to the kitchen to get a knife. He said that he made three striking movements towards his girlfriend. The third time he hit her.
> Together on the wrong path
> Two weeks ago, the Utrecht court zoomed in on the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim. They knew each other from high school and went down the wrong path together. A. and his girlfriend used a lot of drugs together. Although that worsened their relationship, the two continued to see each other. Even when the woman in Leidsche Rijn went to live in a protected housing on the Jan Wolkerssingel.
> The quarrels escalated to such an extent that A. received a restraining order. He smashed everything in her home and threatened her with a knife. A. was convicted for this, but it went wrong again last November. The two had used GHB and A. had been drinking and snorting cocaine. They again clashed, but this time resulting in a fatal stabbing.

> Plea for acquittal
> The suspect's lawyer asked for an acquittal because it could not be ruled out that the victim himself fell into the knife during the quarrel. In addition, it has not been proven that the suspect intentionally wanted to kill his girlfriend. The court acknowledges that there is no evidence that the man actually intended to kill his girlfriend.
> He has, however, been charged with 'conditional intent'. By making stabbing movements with a knife several times, at a short distance, he took the risk that he could kill the victim, according to the judge. On the basis of the statements of the suspect himself and the pathological examination, the court established that there was no question of an accident in which the victim himself was stabbed.
> no storm
> The criminal lawyer also argued that it cannot be ruled out that the man had to defend himself against violence by the victim. Although the suspect was missing a tooth, the court does not agree with this either. A. has stated to the police that he no longer remembers when or how he lost this tooth. At the hearing, he said that he received a blow or kick during the argument with the victim, but it has not become clear when or why this happened. Moreover, A. has never stated that this was the reason for him to take the knife.
> On the basis of this, the court ruled that severe weather was not plausible and convicted the man of manslaughter. According to experts, the Utrecht resident has psychological problems, including an addiction disorder. In addition to the prison sentence of eight years and TBS with compulsory treatment, A. must pay the victim's mother compensation of more than 24,000 euros.



> Knife stab ended the life of Özge (25), ex-lover Ilias speaks of unhappiness: 'I panicked'
> A 25-year-old Utrechter, who was on trial today for the manslaughter of 25-year-old Turkish transwoman Özge Bilir, faces eight years in prison and TBS. Ilias A. is suspected of stabbing his ex-lover Bilir to death on November 11, 2020 in her apartment at Jan Wolkerssingel in Leidsche Rijnwijk Grauwaert.

> They had known each other since they were 13. Share joys and sorrows. And drugs. for years. And it was precisely the combination of coke, GHB and alcohol that produced a deadly cocktail that led to Özge's stabbing. 
> 
> Ilias had come by knowing that she - Özge was staying in a housing project for people with substance abuse problems - did not want him to visit if he was tipsy or under the influence of drugs. He'd been drinking and snorting that afternoon, so she asked him to sleep off his daze in the bedroom. And he didn't like that. The native of Zeist had often drawn a knife when they quarreled. And now he did it again. According to witnesses - who left because of the fight - she said that evening: "You're not going to stab me, are you?" And he replied: "Maybe I will."
> 
> Transformation
> And not much later, one knife stab ended the eventful life of Özge, a well-known social media presence who shared her transformation from male to female at the age of 18. And in the years that followed wanted to break lances for transgenders. After her death, interest groups suggested a 'transmurder', but the Public Prosecution Service attached importance to declaring that it was really a domestic violence case. Ilias accepted from the start the transformation that Özge was going through and supported her in it. 
> 
> The relatives had great difficulty controlling their emotions when they heard Ilias declare that Özge's death was 'an accident' as far as he was concerned. "It looks like I was going to kill her now. I know, I shouldn't have picked up a knife. There was pushing and pulling. I panicked when I was hit. I felt the knife go in. Horrible. I think it was an immune response or something. Really, I take full blame. Don't act pathetic. But I didn't have a plan."

> Appeal to emergency weather
> The arrest for the murder of Özge was for Ilias a low point in his life, in which he stayed in boarding schools and juvenile detention centers. He himself was a victim of abuse and domestic violence. And he came into contact with the law more often, mainly related to property crime, shoplifting and vandalism. He also smashed Özge's household effects to pieces.
> 
>  His counsel said: ,,Özge and my client share a difficult childhood. Including excessive use of narcotics. Client feels guilty, without being guilty. It cannot be ruled out that Özge ran into the knife, or that he acted out of emergency."
> 
> disrespectful
> It was against the sore leg of the Public Prosecution Service. “The suspect has always changed his statements. That's what you do when you're guilty. He remembers many details except the essential moment of how the stabbing moment went. As far as the OM is concerned, returning to society untreated is not an option. The fact that he and his lawyer are now going for acquittal is a step for the next of kin. It was his choice to lose his mind, take drugs and pick up a knife. Placing the blame on Özge is disrespectful.”
> 
> Her mother made an emotional victim statement. "I've supported you through thick and thin. It hurt me how the outside world reacted to your transformation, but I deeply respected how you stood in that. And now? Climbing the Dom together or cycling a bit, it's no longer possible. What did you do to deserve this?"

> Ozge Bilir (25)
> The woman who was stabbed to death in a house in Utrecht at the beginning of this week is Özge Bilir, a 25-year-old transgender woman from Turkey.
> 
> This is the first fatal transgender victim in the Netherlands this year, Trans United Europe confirms.
> 
> According to friends and relatives, the ex-boyfriend is the arrested suspect. The Dutch authorities do not want to say anything about it and talk about a good acquaintance of the victim.
> 
> In the Dutch trans and rainbow community, the violent death of Özge hits like a bomb.
> 
> sad reactions
> 
> The same sad reactions can be heard on Facebook and Twitter. 'Not Ozge, surely? The Özge from Utrecht? That sweet spontaneous and cheerful woman, known for her fun live streams on social media? That happy party animal who just wanted people to laugh?'
> 
> Friends describe 25-year-old Özge Bilir as a resilient person whose boundless energy and tenacity allowed her to become who she wanted to become: an ambitious, strong woman.
> 
> 
> Photo: Ozge (25)
> At a young age, Özge (25) already felt that she could not be herself. That she was born in a different body. “I felt like I was locked in my own body,” she told Dutch media in an interview. “Because you're in the wrong body, it's hard to be yourself.”
> 
> Six years ago, the then 19-year-old made the transition from male to female. The Turkish boy from Utrecht now walked the streets as Özge.
> 
> “My mother with Turkish roots didn't see it coming at all. It really took some getting used to for her, especially in the beginning,” said Özge.
> 
> Her acquaintances had no problem with it at all. They had a lot of admiration for her. “I have nothing more than the utmost respect for Özge for going into transition as a Turkish,” said a close friend.
> 
> Transmoord
> 
> Whether the gender of 25-year-old Özge has anything to do with the murder has yet to be determined. The Dutch police therefore do not want to speak of a 'transmurder'.
> 
> That's ridiculous, says Trans United Europe. “A murder of a trans person is always a trans murder. It is a pity that this remains so unspoken in the media. Precisely by not explicitly naming it, there will never be an end to the misunderstanding surrounding this subject.
> 
> The 25-year-old Turkish Dutchman was a transgender woman. A proud transgender woman. We must continue to name and emphasize that, also to keep her memory alive.”
> 
> Özge Bilir was a resident of the protected housing form in Leidsche Rijn in Utrecht. All residents in this housing form have psychiatric problems. They receive guidance because of their problems.
> 
> The arrested 24-year-old suspect is the suspected ex of Özge. The incident is said to have taken place within the relational sphere.
