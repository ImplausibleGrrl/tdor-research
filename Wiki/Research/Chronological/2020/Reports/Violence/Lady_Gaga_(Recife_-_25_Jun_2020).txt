A transvestite was murdered with a knife in a bus at the Santa Rita Pier Terminal at dawn on Thursday (25). According to the police, the victim, who appeared to be 30, was stabbed at least six times.

The crime took place on a Marcos Freire / Bacurau bus. The driver of the collective, who prefers not to identify himself, told the TV Jornal report that the transvestite tried to protect herself from the killer on the bus. 

“I had the vehicle stopped to leave at 3 am, which was what was expected, when the transvestite, who was murdered, got into the car, running, already asking for help. And then the miscreant got up and I was unable to close the door because there was no time, it was too fast. Then he started stabbing and I still yelled at him not to do that and jumped out of the vehicle to look for a vehicle, to help the transvestite. But, unfortunately, it was too late, I was no longer able to save her ”, reported the bus driver.
The victim, who identified himself as "Lady Gaga", died on the spot. The suspect was still found at the terminal with the bloodied knife used. He confessed to the crime. Also according to the driver, the transvestite was killed because of jealousy.

“It was out of jealousy because the people here started saying that the guy who murdered the transvestite said he was doing it because she shouldn't have messed with his wife. She would be inducing this guy's wife not to be with him anymore and, in a way, she was finding other people for her to relate to. ”

The victim's friend, who also declined to be identified, says that the fight between the killer and the transvestite started around midnight. She came to sense her own death. 

“She came to me and said, 'let me stay here because I'm going to die today'. I told her 'stay here'. But the other one came, the guy who was demonized and pulled her by the hair. He dragged her through her hair until she got to the bus and stabbed her inside the bus, ”he said.

Experts from the Institute of Criminalistics were called in to conduct an on-the-spot investigation. According to expert Diogo Sinésio, the bus monitoring cameras were not working.

“Unfortunately, the camera system was, I think, without the memory card, from what the driver said, and he didn't record it. This harms, but it is not a major factor in not being able to capture the executioners. But I believe that, as investigations progress, some information will be obtained. ”

The arrested suspect was identified as Daniel José de Freitas, 22. In addition to him, a teenager of 17 was apprehended. They were taken to the Homicide and Personal Protection Department (DHPP) in the neighborhood of Cordeiro, West Zone of Recife, where they were fined in the act.
