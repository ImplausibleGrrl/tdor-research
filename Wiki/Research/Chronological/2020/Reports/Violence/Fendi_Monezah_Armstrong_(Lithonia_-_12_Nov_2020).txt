Fendi was found dead from a gunshot wound in a motel room.

> On November 12, 2020 the body of Fendi Mon’ezah Armstrong was discovered in a motel room near Lithonia, Georgia. Fendi was a 39-year-old Black trans woman. She was deceased when police arrived. Police have not yet released any information.  Here’s a link to the initial reporting. Please note that it does misgender and deadname Fendi.
> 
> DeKalb County police are investigating after a [individual]  was shot and killed inside a motel room Wednesday night.
> 
> Armstrong, 39, was discovered in a room at the Knights Inn on Panola Road, according to police. [S]he was dead at the scene.
> 
>  A police spokeswoman said Thursday detectives are still looking into the circumstances surrounding the shooting. No information about a possible motive or suspects was released.
> 
> Born in Springfield, Massachusetts, she recently lived in Charlotte, North Carolina before relocating to Decatur, Georgia. A self-described aspiring motivational heath and beauty advisor, she was known as Peaches.
> 
> It is stunning to realize that police have turned up nothing in such a long period of time, but at this point all we know is that Fendi was found shot dead. There’s no indication from authorities that her gunshot wound was self-inflicted so the natural conclusion is someone else shot her.  I’m not sure why her story isn’t more robustly explored, but I will try to find out. She was laid to rest. She is missed.
>
> Rest in power, Peaches. You deserved a long lifetime to pursue your aspirations and be with your loved ones. May your memory by a revolution. May the person who robbed you of your life be found and held accountable. May we continue to say her name.
