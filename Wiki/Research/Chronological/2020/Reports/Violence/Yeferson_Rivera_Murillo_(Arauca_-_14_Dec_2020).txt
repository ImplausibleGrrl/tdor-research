There is no clarity on the causes of the death of Yeferson Rivera Murillo, a transsexual from Arauca. In the district it was indicated that she died of cardiac arrest. It was known that he was injured a few days ago in Manizales with a knife to the chest. Apparently it got complicated.

In the autopsy of Forensic Medicine, it was said that death occurred as a result of the sequelae of the stab wound. The Prosecutor's Office will determine if it handles it as a homicide. If so, it would enter the statistics of violent deaths in the Caldas capital.
