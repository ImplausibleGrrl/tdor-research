The lifeless body of a person was found inside his home located in block 3 of Jir√≥n Lima , in the San Juan de Lurigancho district .

Katherine Mestanza , niece of the occisa, said that the stylist had been missing since Saturday of last week, because on that date it was the last time they had communication with her.

They called her repeatedly, but Brenda Venegas Ayquipa, a 52-year-old trans woman, did not answer. It was so that this Tuesday, August 4, they went to her house, but it did not open.

They say that they found it strange that the main door of the hairdresser had a safe inside, but not outside. So they brought up a ladder and opened the third-floor window, where they found the body in her room.

Police officers from the Caja de Agua Police Station arrived at the scene and indicated that the body was found tied by the hands and feet with cables, had marks on the neck, and it is presumed that she was hanged, and had bruises on various parts of the body. which would demonstrate the degree of violence with which the murderer (s) acted .
