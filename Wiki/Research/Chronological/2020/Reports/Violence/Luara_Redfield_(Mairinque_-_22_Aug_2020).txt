The father of the young transsexual Luara Redfield, who was found dead after spending 12 days missing in Mairinque (SP), vented about her daughter's boyfriend after the boy was arrested and confessed to the crime.

To G1 , Luis Henrique Leandro Ferreira, who is a pastor, stressed that he was indignant to learn of the crime and discredited the possibility of having been committed out of jealousy. According to the father, they had been together for about six months.

"It wasn't just a crime leveraged by jealousy. Killing like that and hiding the corpse from me doesn't fit. He fits into psychopathy. He's devoid of feeling, of love, of compassion. Cold and calculating. A guy totally without feeling. Crossing his path is destruction and death. This is the trail he leaves wherever he goes and has to be trapped ", he explains.

Luara disappeared on August 10 and, on the 22, the body was found in Jardim Vitória , in an advanced state of decomposition. Her boyfriend Jhonatan Richard de Lima Moreira, 18, was taken to the police station and confessed to the crime.

The court granted his temporary detention for 30 days, at the request of the police, to complete the investigation.

'I never met someone so sweet', says friend of young trans woman found dead
- August 23, 2020

Luara Redfield, 23, has been missing since August 10. Boyfriend was arrested after police found the young woman dead in a pasture area in Mairinque.
"I never met anyone as sweet and someone as good as she was. Even when she was mistreated for being who she was, for being transgender, she remained firm, polite, and never got into a fight."
This is how Luara Redfield, 23, is remembered by her friend Isabella Revelin. The body of the young trans woman was found earlier this Saturday afternoon (22) in Jardim Vitória, in Mairinque (SP).
Her boyfriend, Jonathan Richard Moreira, was arrested on Saturday night, shortly after the body was found in a pasture area in Jardim Vitória, in Mairinque. He was detained in a man in São Roque, a town next to Mairinque.
Luara's body was taken to the Instituto Médico Legal (IML) in Sorocaba and will be sent by a funeral company from Mairinque to São Paulo. The burial will take place at the Fourth Stop Cemetery, around 1 pm.
According to the funeral home, although the family lives in Mairinque, Luara will be buried in the capital of São Paulo at the option of relatives, where the young woman's grandmother is buried.
Luara had been missing since 10 August. G1, friend Isabella told that Luara was a cheerful young woman and very dear to everyone.
"She was always smiling, always cheerful, playing, dancing. I don't think I'll ever meet someone as good as she is," recalls her friend.

According to the Civil Police, the young woman had been dead for a few days. The boyfriend was taken to the police station to provide clarification shortly after the body was located. He had been heard before, when the young woman was missing. During interrogation, the boy confessed to the crime and was arrested after the police asked the court for his preventive detention.

On social media, Luara received several tributes and many people regretted what happened. "Another terrible crime against the LGBT world that cannot remain silent. May the authorities do everything to find the culprits of this barbarism. Here are my feelings for all family members," wrote one resident.
"There is no other word to describe Luara besides being sensational. The human being that she was, with such kindness. I am sure that there is no other equal in the world," adds Isabella.
Remember the case
The young woman's friends and family made a task force in search of Luara, who disappeared on August 10. Even a kitty was made to distribute posters around the city.
The Mairinque Civil Police heard the transgender's boyfriend, who was with her on the day the young woman disappeared. According to the victim's relatives, Luara and his partner argued on the day of the disappearance.
According to the Civil Police, the boy said he took a bus from Kiko and Chiko square, went to São Roque and then to Itapevi, where he lives. At the time, the young woman would have stayed in the square after the two said goodbye.
Luara's father also clarified the investigation. As informed to TV TEM, Luara's father said that he got in touch with his daughter's boyfriend when he realized that she had not returned. The boy had previously stated that he had gone home alone.
