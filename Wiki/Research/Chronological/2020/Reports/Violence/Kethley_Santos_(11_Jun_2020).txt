A transvestite was assaulted in Largo da Sete Portas and another murdered in the neighborhood of Piatã, in Salvador. Both cases happened on Thursday (11).

The first victim, whose identity was not revealed, was beaten at Rua Djalma Dutra, at 8 am. The transvestite was rescued by a team from the Mobile Emergency Service (Samu), who moved to the scene of the event with the police. According to the report, the violence was a transphobic attack, committed by a group of strangers.

The fatal victim, identified as Kethley Santos, was attacked on Avenida Octávio Mangabeira, at around 5 am. The victim reportedly tried to call for help but died near a local pharmacy. Associations linked to transsexuality issued a collective letter out of respect for the victim's memory, who was born in Ipirá, about 200 km from Salvador.


Entities that defend the right of trans people have released a letter in which they denounce the practice of discrimination against trans women Kethley Santos, born in Ipirá and killed in Salvador, whose social name was not respected during the funeral.

The document is signed by the National Association of Transvestites and Transsexuals (Antra), Association of Students Ipiraenses (Aeipi), Brazilian Association of Lesbians, Gays, Bisexuals, Transvestites and Transsexuals, Bahia Association of Transvestites, Transsexuals and Transgender in Action and the Collective of trans forward.

According to the letter, Kethely was shot dead at dawn on Thursday (11) in the Bahian capital. The body was transferred to the victim's hometown, but the announcement about the death in the city of Bahia, made by family members, did not divulge the death respecting Kethely's social name.

“When reporting the death, some relatives, teachers, professors and acquaintances

Ipirá's are disrespecting her name and her existence as a woman,

as a trans person ”, says an excerpt from the letter.

The document also lists the difficulties faced by trans people in the city. “It is very complex to discuss issues of gender and sexuality and respect for the identities of trans and transvestites in Ipirá. A city in the Sertão Baiano that is still strongly ordered by the religious-Christian moral sieve and submitted to an oligarchic political dynamic. The discomfort and fear of walking the streets accompanies the existence of trans people in any city, whether in the countryside or in the capitals. Because no place is safe for trans and transvestites, ”says one of the paragraphs in the letter.

The entities cite data on violence and homicides of trans people recorded by Antra. According to the text, in 2019 the entity registered 124 notified cases of murders of trans and transvestites. Of this total, 82% were black people. The information from 2020 is also cited, the letter informs that in the first two months of this year there were 38 reports of murders of trans people.

Finally, the text calls on society to reinforce the fight against transphobia. (BN)
