The family of transvestite Isabella Pedrozo, 22, shot to death in Porto Alegre, last Sunday (23), participates in the burial this morning (26) amid sadness and revolt. The young woman was murdered inside the Motel San Diego, on Avenida Eduardo Prado, in the Ipanema neighborhood, south of the city. According to the Civil Police, the crime is involved with drug trafficking, but that Isabella was killed just for being beside the target.

Parents live in the Pilarzinho neighborhood in Curitiba. The girl's father, Mario Pedrozo, said that the daughter lived in Porto Alegre a few months ago. “She was there for a while, lived with friends, but her fixed address was here, with us. At that time, the press talks a lot, but what I want to show is that she had a family, will have a decent funeral and everything, ”he said.

He also said that he traveled by car for about 20 hours to Porto Alegre to release his daughter's body. “I didn't want to go to the police station, I didn't want anything. I went there, released the body and that's it. I want to give her a decent burial. There's no drugs, she was in the wrong place at the wrong time. He got involved with a guy who was an airplane and that happened ”, lamented the father.

The wake of the transvestite takes place this Wednesday morning (26) at the Vatican Cemetery. Friends and family will pay homage until 11:30 am, where they will then proceed to Isabella's burial.

The Civil Police of Porto Alegre guarantees that Isabella was killed without fault. “The fact is completely related to the boy, not to her. She was killed only because she was with him, without any guilt with the motivation, ”said Deputy Rodrigo Pohlmann Garcia, from Delegate 4th Homicide and Personal Protection Police (DHPP).

According to the deputy, Isabella was a call girl and had already gone out with the boy who was with her at the motel a few times. “They had known each other for a short time, but they had already been together a few times. As she was a call girl, she even helped him with the purchase of drugs. She kind of played the guy. They would have gone to that motel, they were there and, around 11 pm, he was on the phone and she was sleeping, when they knocked on the door saying it was the police, ”according to the chief.

At that moment, the boy managed to hide in the bathroom. “It is very common, they say they are policemen for people to open their doors. This young man who already has a ticket is a friend of people from Porto Alegre. He was suspicious, opened the window, one of the people aimed his pistol and he managed to run to the bathroom. Through the window, they made several shots, as Isabella was sleeping, tried to get up, due to the dynamics of the body, but she couldn't resist ”, concluded the police officer responsible for the crime.



This week started in a mood of mourning for the LGBTI community in Curitiba. Isabella Soares, 22 years old, was murdered in the capital of Rio Grande do Sul, in a crime that points to accountability with her companion. Isabella has lived in Canoas since the beginning of the year and may have been killed by mistake.

For the police, the man who was in the room with her was the target of the gang of three men who broke into the San Diego motel in the Ipanema neighborhood and ordered the door to be opened. With the negative, they fired several shots with a 9mm pistol through a window, which hit Isabella three times and she died on the spot. The crime occurred around 11 pm on Sunday.

The 24-year-old who was with her has a criminal record. He hid in the bathroom and was the one who called the Military Brigade after the criminals left the place. The 4th Homicide Police Station in Porto Alegre (4th DPHPP) of the Civil Police investigates the murder. Apparently, in a brief internet search, executions inside motels in Rio Grande do Sul are common.

On the internet, friends remember how sweet and always humorous Isabella was. She passed away very young, which shocked many friends. The violence against the trans population is such that the life expectancy of a trans person in Brazil is 35 years. Isabella, unfortunately, did not reach this age, having her life tragically taken. Let his death be solved and the guilty be punished. Our feelings remain with Isabella's family and her friends who suffer from the loss.

It is worth praising the police of Rio Grande do Sul and the Rio Grande do Sul press that did not treat the death of the young trans in a sensationalist way, always referring to her as a woman, without revealing her transsexuality.
