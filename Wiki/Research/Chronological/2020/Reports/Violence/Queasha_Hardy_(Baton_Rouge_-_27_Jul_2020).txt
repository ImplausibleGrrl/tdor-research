Black trans woman Queasha Hardy, 24, was found shot to death on a street in Baton Rouge, La., Monday afternoon, according to The Advocate, a Baton Rouge newspaper that is not related to this publication. The outlet initially identified her as male, but several friends told reporters she was a trans woman.

She is being widely mourned on her Facebook page. Friends planned a balloon release in her memory for Tuesday afternoon.
