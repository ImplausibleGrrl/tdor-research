stabbed



Stephanie Cardona Matías was 32 years old and was found murdered on Tuesday, March 17, by her companions. When they realized that she had not been seen in recent days, they went to her home accompanied by the National Civil Police. Stephanie had multiple injuries to the neck caused by a knife that caused her death, according to the National Institute of Forensic Sciences (Inacif). Her murder is presumed to have taken place on March 15.

Originally from Guatemala City, she lived in the Mixco area, 17 kilometers from the city and was a sex worker in a bar located at calle 7 and avenida 6 in zona 4 of the capital. Sometimes she stayed to sleep there because she had to do double shifts to survive. According to sources close to him who requested a reservation, he had received death threats on the Friday prior to his transfemicide.

"She was a very polite person, smiling, kind, loving, joking, never angry." This is how his sister Ingrid remembered him, in dialogue with Presentes. Their mother passed away when they were little. Her brother went to the United States. According to Ingrid, Stephanie was never loved by her father. Since she was little, she sent her to live with her maternal grandmother and when she learned of her transition, she rejected her even more. Stephanie lived with her grandmothers or with her aunt. At 18, when she began her transition, she was forced to leave her family's home, as happens to so many trans in Latin America.

The violence against us does not stop

" Even in the midst of this health crisis, the violence against us does not stop ", expressed the organization Otrans Reinas de la Noches when reporting his murder in a statement. “We patent our solidarity with the family and friends of the disappeared today and we mourn her death so unjust, so unnecessary, so nonsense. We take this opportunity to infinitely thank Hospicio San José, who once again, as in many cases before, managed to give away the box to bury Stephanie ”.


Two transfeminicides in March 2020
With Stephanie, there are already at least three transfemicides reported so far this year and the second in a month. Luisa Sandoval Lemus was a 24-year-old trans girl who lived in the Entre Ríos village, in the Izabal department in the Puerto Barrios municipality, 287 kilometers from Guatemala City. She had disappeared on Thursday, February 27. Neighbors found her dead on March 2.

Why are the investigations of these or other hate crimes not progressing in the Justice? The lawyer Fran Riviero responds: “The Public Ministry does not give the importance of the case. Sometimes there is no will to investigate beyond the evidence they have at hand. And in the absence of a gender identity norm, such cases do not have the momentum that femicides in cisgender women have. The main challenges prosecutors face in these cases are the fact that it cannot legally be treated as femicide. But also how saturated the system is in general, that if the evidence is not available, they will not make an effort to obtain it, and the implicit discrimination in all areas, which limits the objectivity and efficiency of their work ”.

The Office of the Human Rights Ombudsman, through Henry Spain, of the Sexual Diversity Ombudsman, tells this medium that there has been no progress in the investigation of the three transfemicides so far this year. But that the Prosecutor's Office undertakes to follow up on them through the process of requesting public information in the month of April, as it thinks that it is a reasonable time for progress to be made.
