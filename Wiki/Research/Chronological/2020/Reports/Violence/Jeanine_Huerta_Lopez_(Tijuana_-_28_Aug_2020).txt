Janine Huerta was a transgender woman, activist, health and rights advocate for the trans community, loyal friend, and beloved daughter. She was found dead on the night of Thursday, August 28, in the living room of her house located in the Francisco Villa neighborhood, in the city of Tijuana. Her body showed signs of blows to the face and injuries made with a stab weapon. Those who knew her say it is a murder by transphobia, because she had no problems with anyone.

People close to Janine reported that she was seen alive for the last time on Monday, August 24, when she went to celebrate a birthday in the company of friends, but, as of Tuesday, August 25, she stopped responding to messages on her cell phone; On Wednesday they tried to contact her by calls and messages on her different social networks without success, so on the afternoon of Thursday, August 27, they went to look for her at her apartment, fearing that something had happened to her.

When they arrived at the home, around 8 pm, they noticed that the trunk of Janine's vehicle was open, a sign that made them believe that she was at home, however, when they got closer they received a strange smell in the environment, but they tried to ignore it. They yelled at her by name several times waiting for her to come out, but she never came out.

Given the null response, they tried to open the main door of the apartment, which was open, so they entered calling her at all times. Inside the building, the fetid smell became stronger, in addition, at the entrance they detected traces of blood and found the room in disarray, everything had been moved and it was clear that some electronic devices had been taken.

“We saw the dump, from the front door you could see the living room and its kitchen. On the right side is his living room and we noticed that it was all turned over, removed, thrown away, and the TV was not there, there was a lot of blood in the mere entrance of the house, and when looking at the side of the kitchen on the left side, there it was Janine's body was lying on the floor, it was covered from the top with a black cloth and she only had her underwear on, ”said one of the people interviewed.

After the discovery, they called 911. Four units of the Municipal Police arrived at the place, who obtained the testimony and later agents from the Crimes Against Life Group of the State Investigation Agency arrived. Janine's body was transferred by personnel from the Forensic Medical Service (Semefo) and until the afternoon of Friday, August 28, it had not been handed over to her relatives.

Neighbors reported, anonymously, that at dawn on Thursday, August 27, four men were removing belongings from Janine's apartment, a situation that they reported to officers who were patrolling the area, without doing anything about it.

Janine did not want to be part of the statistics on violence against trans women

During her life, Janine worked in different areas, working as a call center agent until she practiced sex work as a way of subsistence, work that she divided with her functions as a health promoter at Centro de Servicios Ser AC, the main activity that she carried out even before his murder.

For Janine it was not a reason to be ashamed to dedicate herself to sex work, but she was aware that it was not something she would dedicate all her life to, so she let it be known on April 29, when she was interviewed as part of the note “Workers sex in Tijuana, left to their own devices during a health contingency ”, published in the 2405 issue of Semanario Zeta.

“I have not been 100 percent oriented to being a sex worker, of course, I have held the position, but I have always been inclined to say that I do not want to be a sex worker, that is why after all the circumstances that have happened to me, I don't want to die, I don't want to be part of that statistic anymore, that's why I haven't let go of my job as a health promoter, ”Janine said in the interview conducted on April 29, 2020.

Rosario Padilla, director of Centro de Servicios Ser, shared that Janine had been working for 9 years in the support group for trans women, being part of the training given to the then Federal Electoral Institute (now known as INE), with which it was sought that the institute staff was sensitized with the trans community and that trans men and women obtained their credentials with the photo of how they identified themselves.

After this training, Janine was one of the first trans women to make the photograph on her credential match the gender with which she identified. Subsequently, she was working as a promoter of sexual and reproductive health in Centro de Servicios Ser, and was part of a research project at the University of San Diego, California, which sought to identify support networks for the transgender community.

“This is how she arrived, looking for a space to feel safe, a space to share with her community, a space to watch over the human rights of the other girls; She always said, I don't want to be part of the statistic, I don't want to be just another statistic, and she always looked for support from the other girls, and let's hope it's not just another statistic, that this time justice will be achieved in her name, ”Padilla said.

He highlighted that Janine always sought to support the trans community, accompanying people who were seeking to change their name and gender on the birth certificate throughout Baja California, whom she advised to carry out their process and the steps to follow.

“I remember Janine as a strong woman, I will always remember her as a proactive woman, always looking for improvement, she worked for a long time in an over-wheel, sold clothes, because there was a resistance in her, in which her story was going to be different, she trusted that there would be working conditions for trans women… She was committed to her community, she did not seek recognition, she always worked behind the scenes ”, noted the director of Centro Servicios Ser.

Transgender community in Baja California without protection

The murder of Janine Huerta López is only found in an investigation folder by the State Attorney General's Office (FGE), who in their information card, classified Janine's body as "of sex to be determined", a matter that is qualified by the teacher in Public Health and LGBT activist, Andrés Gaeta Rivera, as part of the failure to apply the protocols and guidelines that exist, in addition to the fact that at the institutional level there is no category of trans people.

“This murder is like a wake-up call not to forget the inequities and the tremendous gaps that are with the trans community, which seems to me, that a lot is a call, again, to what we are doing, both heterosexual and gay men, so that these situations of violence do not happen, because his murder is a sexist act and many times, we do not focus on what decisions and what actions and aggressions men are taking in different community and institutional spaces ”, Gaeta Rivera declared.

He stressed that even though the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) already has protocols to act in cases where sexual orientation and gender identity are involved, at the municipal and state level, as well as different organizations, they do not know how to incorporate these guidelines or ignore.

On the other hand, she emphasized that it should be activated to make the trans community visible, to give them a voice and dedicate efforts to the needs of trans women and men, on issues such as the labor issue, where many trans women are expelled from family circles, from school and work, they are exposed to very precarious spaces.

“When there is a murder of trans women, we are alarmed, but suddenly it is something that happens because we are not close to people, because as a society we have been in charge of expelling trans people so much that when a question of trans violence happens it hurts us It surprises us, but we see it very far away ”, said the activist.

Rosario Padilla, who in recent years has worked closely with the trans community, pointed out that they are a sector of the population without protection from the authorities.
“There is no protection, starting because they do not enter into the statistics of feminicides of transgender women, and to date there is no data on how many crimes due to transphobia have been clarified or how many people have been arrested. There are also no statistics on murdered transgender women, so there is no trust in the Baja California authorities. And yes, we believe that Janine's murder was a hate crime due to transphobia, ”said the director of Centro Servicios Ser.

Currently, trans women who are forced to work as sex workers due to lack of opportunities in the world of work due to transphobia, are violated daily, reporting not only abuses of authority, but also deprivation of their freedom, workplace violence, physical, economic and verbal.
