shot



It has happened again.

On Wednesday, October 7, 2020, the body of Brooklyn DeShauna Smith was discovered at 2:15 in the afternoon in a Shreveport, Louisiana apartment complex. Cause of death was gun shot. Brooklyn was a 20-year-old Black trans woman.

Brooklyn was born and raised in Shreveport. She studied cosmetology at Bossier Parish Community College and had worked as a call center agent. Her social media was full of positivity, good humor, and family support – the typical content you expect from a 20-year-old young woman. She was vibrant and eager to embrace what the world had to offer.

Brook had turned 20 on September 20, 2020. She celebrated with loved ones. Then this – shot and left to die.
Authorities urge anyone with any information about this homicide to call Shreveport police detectives at (318) 673-6955. Or call the Police Department at (318) 673-7300 and select option 3.

Brooklyn or Brook as she was known is the 32nd trans and gender nonconforming person murdered to date in 2020 in the United States. She is the 21st Black trans person and the 20th Black trans woman murdered.  She is the 5th person from Louisiana, all of whom were Black trans women.  She is one of 12 victims age 25 or younger and one of the four youngest total – Yampi Mendez Arocho was 19, Helle Jae O’Regan was also 20, and Brayla Stone was just 17.

I learned about Brooklyn’s death a few hours after learning that Black transgender activist and blogger, Monica Roberts, had died earlier this week. Perhaps Monica was there to comfort and welcome Brooklyn. I grieve that Monica is not here to help seek justice for a 20-year-old trans kid, and to be honest, to help guide me in the right direction in writing this post. I counted on Monica as a friend and colleague to shine a light for allies like me trying to do right by the victims of this epidemic. But this post is not about Monica nor would she want Brooklyn’s death to be overshadowed by her own. The assumption now is that Monica died of injuries related to being the victim of a hit and run in the parking lot of her apartment complex.

But I do think the fact that Brooklyn’s death has not been picked up by the queer media is tied to Monica’s death a few days earlier. She was the bellwether. And this is evidence that her death will have deep ramifications for the most vulnerable Black trans folks.

How does a 20-year-old end up dying alone in an apartment from a gunshot wound in the middle of the day? There is no way Monica would let that pass, especially being so close to her home turn in Houston, without calling for attention and resources. I’d have to do a deep dive into my archive, but I suspect the number of trans neighbors murdered in broad daylight is on the rise. That’s only possible in a society that doesn’t acknowledge the visibility and validity of trans folx, especially trans woman and especially Black trans women.

Rest in power, Brooklyn. You deserved a full adult life with all of the experiences and wonders so many of us take for granted. You deserved to explore the world, surrounded by your loved ones, and valued for simply being you. We will continue to say your name and push for justice.  I hope you are wrapped in a big hug from your Aunt Moni and finding peace.




Trans Homicides Reach Tragic Milestone With Louisiana Woman's Death
Brooklyn DeShauna Smith
Brooklyn DeShauna Smith is the 32nd transgender American known to have died by violence in 2020.

2020 is officially the deadliest year on record for transgender Americans, with the death of Shreveport, La., resident Brooklyn DeShauna Smith being the 32nd reported homicide.

Smith was found dead in her apartment Wednesday afternoon, having suffered at least one gunshot wound, the Shreveport Times reports. She was 20 years old.

“Investigators are working to determine if gender identification was a factor in her death,” Shreveport Police Sgt. Angie Willhite said, according to local TV station KSLA.

Shreveport Police ask that anyone with information call detectives at (318) 673-6955 or the main number, (318) 673-7300, and select option 3. Tips may also be submitted to Shreveport-Caddo Crime Stoppers by phone at (318) 673-7373, visiting the group’s website, or using the P3 Tips app to offer information anonymously.

Until this year, 2017 was the deadliest year for trans Americans since media and activists began keeping records, with 31 homicides reported. The actual figure for any given year is likely higher, given that many trans people are misgendered or deadnamed by police and media, or their deaths not reported at all. More accurate reporting may be responsible for some increase in numbers, but in any case, it’s clear there is an epidemic of violence of against trans people, especially Black women.

The figure of 32 homicides in 40 weeks represents one every nine days, the Human Rights Campaign notes. Since HRC began tracking trans homicides in 2013, it has documented 197, with two-thirds of victims being Black women and more than 60 percent involving gun violence.

HRC President Alphonso David issued a statement calling Smith’s death “a tragic milestone.” He continued, “Each person was ripped from their family, their friends and their community by an act of senseless violence driven by bigotry and transphobia, and inflamed by the rhetoric of those who oppose our progress.

“Dehumanizing rhetoric, especially by political leaders like President Trump, has a real-life consequence for the community, particularly transgender women of color and especially Black transgender women. As the presidential campaign has hit its crescendo, so too has the attacks coming from Trump, his administration and his allies. They have spent millions on ads spewing hate and lies about the transgender and gender-nonconforming community, and have attacked their right to health care, right to serve and right to live openly — dehumanizing and denying them the dignity they deserve at every opportunity.

“Every life has value, and we must utilize this moment to not only remember Brooklyn and each and every one of the people killed this year, but take action and work to dismantle this culture of violence and stigma that the transgender and gender-nonconforming community faces. Our community’s lives are on the line, and we must commit with every breath to fight for the change we need.”
