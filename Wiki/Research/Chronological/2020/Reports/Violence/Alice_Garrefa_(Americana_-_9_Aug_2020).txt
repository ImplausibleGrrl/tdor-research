he American Civil Police located the body of transsexual Alice Garrefa, who lives in Sertãozinho, on the Piracicaba River, this Sunday morning. It was located in the vicinity of the city of Americana and was last seen on August 3, in Ribeirão Preto.

At the time, she was in a motel on Avenida Barão do Bananal in the company of a man. The couple remained at the scene for about ten minutes, and then she was no longer seen. Family and friends even ran a campaign on social media asking for information to locate the transvestite , but without success.

The Civil Police arrived at the body after being alerted by popular people. The Legal Medical Institute (IML) of Americana made the identification of the body, which was identified with the hands behind. No further details on the cause of death were released.

A police report was registered by the transsexual's family in Sertãozinho and the Civil Police investigated the case.

Testimonial
To the Civil Police, the transsexual's mother informed that Alice had a relationship with a man from Florianópolis (SC) and that she was even threatened with death by him. The partner would be jealous of Alice and would not accept her going out with other men. She even announced that she did sexual programs on social media.

According to the police report, Alice spent a few days at a friend's house in Ribeirão and did programs in the city. The alleged companion would have called the makeup artist on the night of August 3 and posing as someone else, with a different phone number. The pretext was to schedule a program.

Alice accepted and, according to the Civil Police, disappeared after the meeting. The man has already been identified and is being investigated by the authorities as a suspect in the murder.
