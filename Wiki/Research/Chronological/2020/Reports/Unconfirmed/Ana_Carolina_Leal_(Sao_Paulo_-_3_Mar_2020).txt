A video released yesterday on social networks caused a wave of indignation and revolt in the city of São Paulo , Brazil. Ana Carolina Leal , 26, was beaten by two men and one of the witnesses of the crime filmed the assault , but did not help the victim . Many other people and passengers in vehicles saw what happened, but did not try to help Ana Carolina, a transsexual. The victim was on his way to a local market when he was harassed by the attackers. After the provocations of the two men, he responded and asked to leave her "in peace". It was at the exit of the market that she was intercepted by the duo, equipped with iron bars, with which they attacked her in almost all parts of the body.

Transsexual did not seek medical help for being in the country illegally
After the crime , they fled the scene and have not yet been arrested or identified by police authorities. According to the victim, the beating ended only when the attackers showed tiredness. The young woman became unconscious and ended up being rescued by a friend, who passed by the place and identified her. Ana would have been on the floor for more than half an hour without being helped by any witnesses. He suffered serious injuries to his back, head, legs and arms, having been "a week in bed".
