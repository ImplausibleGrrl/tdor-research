Regina was the first trans woman from Colima to be able to legally change her gender identity, in 2015, but she had to travel to Mexico City to achieve it, then she worked to materialize that right in her state.

Regina Zoé Magallón Medina, activist for the rights of sexual diversity, suffered a serious attack on Thursday, September 3, in the municipality of Tecomán, in Colima, which put her life at risk.

Although, according to information provided by her friend and fighting partner, Alex Pizano, Regina is now stable, after surgery and a blood transfusion, her condition is still delicate. "She is still in the hospital due to the series of traumas and injuries that were inflicted on her, but she is already conscious."

Pizano assures that they do not know what this attack could be due to. "There is an investigation being carried out by the prosecution, Regina herself asked us for restraint, because the investigation is ongoing."

Regina was the first trans woman from Colima to be able to legally change her gender identity, in 2015. But to achieve this, she had to go to Mexico City and ask for the support of a civil association, which had to intercede with the efforts to to be authorized: at that time it was required to be a resident of the capital of the country to obtain it.

After that, Regina began the fight so that in her state, Colima, legislation was passed for the right to access gender identity. "She promotes and accompanies all that struggle, until in 2019 the initiative is drawn up and approved to guarantee that right," says Pizano.
