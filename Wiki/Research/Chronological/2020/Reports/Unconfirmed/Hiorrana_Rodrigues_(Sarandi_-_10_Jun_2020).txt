Three Civil Police teams were at the scene of the crime, where 20 ammunition cases were found. The police were unable to obtain images from surveillance cameras. 

Soon after the murder, the police went to the suspect's home, but he was not found. Later, people set fire to his house. 

He was caught in the act during the dawn of this Thursday, 11, and sent to the public jail in Sarandi. The suspect denies participation in the crime but, according to the Civil Police, his interrogation presented relevant contradictions. 

A witness informed police that the arrested suspect was at the victim's home on the morning of the day of the crime and reportedly threatened the victim with death. The police did not disclose the motivation for the murder.
