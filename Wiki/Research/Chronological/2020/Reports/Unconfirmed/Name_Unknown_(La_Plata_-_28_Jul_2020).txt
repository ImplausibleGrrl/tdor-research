stabbed (survived?)


A trans woman was stabbed in a street in the Red Zone

Again the area of ??streets that are referred to as the so-called Red Zone was the scene of an episode of violence that the police are now investigating.

It happened in the block of 4 between 63 and 64 during the early hours of the morning when a transgender woman was wounded in various parts of the body after being attacked with a knife. The victim was transferred to a hospital where assistance is provided.

Police arrived at the scene after receiving an alert from the 911 emergency phone line and found the woman, 37, who had stab wounds to her buttock, face and chest.

The case is in addition to other violent episodes in the area, ranging from drug disputes and fights to violent robberies. Police sources do not rule out in the latter case any of the hypotheses.
