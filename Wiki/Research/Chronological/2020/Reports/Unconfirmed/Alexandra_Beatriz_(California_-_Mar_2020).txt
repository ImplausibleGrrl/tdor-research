It's hard to have to believe that you are not here; today serious some of that day we were going to be preached in tel; on the camera of zap you telling your life your problems your fears, I too; but you left without saying goodbye; you left to make your passage Your journey; I pray I ask God to guide you but I miss you donate and as donate; but one thing for sure your friendship completed me I feel big empty; but one day we will meet again rest in peace!!! Alexandra Beatriz Xandelly
