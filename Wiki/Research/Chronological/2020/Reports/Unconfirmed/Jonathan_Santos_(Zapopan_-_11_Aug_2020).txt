Guadalajara (Mexico), Aug 13 (EFE) .- A hundred students, teachers and family members demonstrated this Thursday to demand justice for the murder of Jonathan Santos, a young LGBT activist from the state of Jalisco (western Mexico) whose death is investigated by the State Prosecutor's Office as femicide, among other lines.

At dawn last Tuesday, the 18-year-old young man and a student at the Polytechnic of the University of Guadalajara was found dead a few blocks from his house in a popular neighborhood in the municipality of Zapopan, shot in the head.

With banners, white balloons and dresses in black and white, his classmates held a simple protest inside the school where he studied, keeping his distance and protected with face masks.

"Homosexuality is not a disease, homophobia, yes", "Justice for Jonathan Santos" and "We are not complete, we are missing you" were some of the phrases they expressed on their banners.
