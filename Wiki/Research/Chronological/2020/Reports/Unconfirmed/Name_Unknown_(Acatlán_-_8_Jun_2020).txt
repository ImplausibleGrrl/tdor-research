Possible trans person, remains found in Acatlán

Possibly they were of a  trans person , the  human remains found in a ravine  between the limits of the municipality of  Acatlán de Osorio  and  Izúcar de Matamoros , which were reported through an anonymous call, which  were presumed to belong to a woman .

According to sources from the State Attorney General's Office (FGE), the human remains found in past days in the area known as " El Palmar ", about  30 meters from the Izúcar de Matamoros-Acatlán de Osorio highway

Given that  the remains have 90 percent bones  and only a  small part had skin , in addition to the fact that the remains of the hands still had  long , painted nails , the ministerial authorities  assume at first instance that it could be a transvestite .

The body wore black tennis shoes with green, a blue pants or mallon, as well as a  black men's shirt , a   white men's brief  and a  navy blue women's vest  .

This fact  draws the attention of the authorities , since if they had not called, no one would have found the skeleton since, in the ravine where  they were, it was difficult to access  and they were  extremely hidden, under some rocks .

The facts were established with the CDI code 284/2020 / Izúcar.
