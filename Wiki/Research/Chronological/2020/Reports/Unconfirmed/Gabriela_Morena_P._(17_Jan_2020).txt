Friday, January 17, 2020

A transvestite was shot in Rouillón and Abor Origen Argentinos, in the southwest area of Rosario, after having an argument with two men who apparently were from the same area.

The aggression occurred at 0.30 yesterday when Gabriela Morena P., 32, was standing in that corner and suddenly two men approached her who she apparently knew. After shouting something that the neighbors could not hear the men shot him twice. One shot hit her in the left buttock and the other in the right arm.

The transvestite lives a few blocks from there, in Passage A to 5800. Upon hearing the detonations some neighbors went outside and agreed that one of the attackers could be a man they know of the neighborhood and is nicknamed "El Cordobés."

Serious

When the Sies ambulance arrived, paramedics diagnosed the wounds and transferred the patient to the Clemente Alvarez Emergency Hospital. Once admitted, doctors assessed that the victim's health status is "serious", since the shot that entered him by the arm entered his body and affected some vital organs. In this sense, they expressed that from their situation they are not "apt to declare".

Prosecutor Matías Edery, who took the case, ordered the survey of security cameras in the area and the taking of witness statements that occasionally witnessed the aggression.
