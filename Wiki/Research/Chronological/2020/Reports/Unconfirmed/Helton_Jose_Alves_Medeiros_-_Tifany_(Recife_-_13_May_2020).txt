A man was found dead with a wire wrapped around his neck, indoors, in the neighborhood of Jardim São Paulo, in the West Zone of Recife, this Wednesday (13).

The victim was identified as Helton José Alves Medeiros, 51. He was known as Tifany and was found with an antenna wire around his neck.

According to the police, a TV and a cell phone of the victim were taken from the residence, which can characterize a robbery, which is theft followed by death. However, no hypothesis has been ruled out. The police investigate the motivation and the authorship of the crime.
