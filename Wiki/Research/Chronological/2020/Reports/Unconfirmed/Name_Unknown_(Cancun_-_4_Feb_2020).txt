Balean travesti who resisted an assault in Cancun
They mercilessly shot a transvestite, who presented a gunshot wound in the leg for resisting an assault, so paramedics transferred him to the hospital

A transvestite was shot dead after resisting an assault at a gas station located at the intersections of Xtepec and Puerto Juárez avenues in superblock 200 of Cancun.

 This happened around 10:15 in the morning when they were alerted by an anonymous call to the emergency number 9-1-1, for detonations of firearms in the place, a report that was attended by elements of the Quintana Police Roo

In the place, a man dressed as a woman had a gunshot wound in his leg, so they requested help from the rescue forces, who arrived to transfer him to the hospital to receive medical attention.

Apparently there were two people arrested, but so far it is not known if they have any relationship in the robbery , so agents of the prosecutor general arrived at the place to take cognizance of the facts and initiate the corresponding investigations.

In the place it transpired that the person had been following him by subjects who had noticed that they had withdrawn a sum of money, which is why the lovers of lovers of others did not hesitate to perform their wrongdoing.
