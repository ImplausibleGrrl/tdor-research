A rotten body tied up with hands and with signs of strangulation found in an Luis Donaldo Colosio colony's shop could be considered the second act of hatred towards sexual diversity after the case of a violently terminated trans woman, Omar Hip√≥lito Ortiz said in an interview, Head of the Unit of Sexual Diversity in Solidarity.

In this regard, the activist announced that they are working with citizen awareness actions because two hate crimes so far in the administration are indicators that there is work to be done, so they currently focus on schools with talks about respect for sexual diversity in Playa del Carmen.
