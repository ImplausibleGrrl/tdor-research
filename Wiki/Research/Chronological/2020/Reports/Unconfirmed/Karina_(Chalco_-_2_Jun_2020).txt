Chalco
Mexico
stabbed (survived?)
[NOT ON TDOR 2020 LIST]


Karen, a transsexual woman, originally from Honduras, was stabbed in the stomach on the night of Thursday, June 2 in Chalco, State of Mexico, and her health is in poor condition.

Kenya Cuevas, director of the Casa de las Muñecas Tiresias association, reported that Karen had an emergency operation at the specialty hospital in Ixtapaluca and they are awaiting the medical report.

The assault, for which a complaint has already been filed, occurred while doing sex work, Kenya said.

The medical attention she received was delayed, because although she was transferred to the nearest hospitals, they only attend to cases of COVID-19, so they did not receive it despite the severity of her injury.

"The attack occurred in Los Álamos, Chalco, along the San Gregorio Cuautzingo highway, and it was quite a pilgrimage to be attended to. We went through two hospitals in the municipality and they did not want to attend to them due to COVID issues," he says.

He says that the first hospital that denied him attention was the Amecameca hospital, later Pedro López, in Ixtapaluca.


Finally, she entered the Ixtapaluca specialty hospital where she underwent surgery after assessing her 15-centimeter wound in the stomach.

Karen is 45 years old, has been a sex worker since she arrived in Mexico City. She has been living in the country for 30 years.

According to Kenya, the assault investigation folder was started as an attempt at femicide.

"We are tired of being raped, tired of not being given the opportunity to get ahead, because we also support our families, we also have family members waiting for us and nobody cares," said Kenya.

In 2016 Paola Buenrostro was assassinated a couple of blocks from the Cuauhtémoc city hall. Paola, a sex worker, got into a client's car. She barely advanced a few meters when Kenya heard screams, followed by gunshots. The guy who killed Paola tried to shoot her, but the gun jammed. The woman was able to record the murderer. Despite this, the prosecution released him.

In Mexico there is no official registry on hate crimes based on sexual orientation or gender identity, but in 2019 activists created a National Observatory made up of local organizations from 10 entities that, considering only those territories, has recorded at least 209 murders. from 2014 to May 2020.

According to the Observatory study, trans women are the most victims of these crimes, in 44.5% of the time, followed by effeminate men, in 40.7%.

Of the 209 homicides registered, 49 were in Veracruz, 37 in Chihuahua, 28 in Michoacán, 22 in Guerrero, 18 in Puebla, 14 in Coahuila, 13 in Mexico City, 12 in Nuevo León, 10 in Jalisco and 6 in Baja California.
