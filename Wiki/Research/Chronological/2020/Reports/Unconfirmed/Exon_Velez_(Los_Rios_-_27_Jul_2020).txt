LGBT organizations in Ecuador denounced on Monday the alleged machete murder of two members of the collective, whose bodies appeared with deep cuts in the province of Los Ríos.
 
In a statement, the Silhouette X Association, the Ecuadorian Federation of LGBT Organizations and the National Trans Revolution Platform, mention that the event occurred "against two people from generic sex populations" in the Buena Fe canton of the mentioned province.
 
The complaint points to a violent act, although, consulted by Efe, the Police have not yet pronounced or confirmed the event.
 
Exon better known as the "ladybug" was found in a lotion near his home, with deep cuts on his right arm and leg. Also on the right side several deep cuts apparently made with a machete in the neck, the organizations detailed.
 
On the other hand, [Henry] who appears to be his partner, was also killed. His body was found in the same condition with deep cuts that have apparently been caused by a machete. In addition, he was found in a pool of blood and near Exón Vélez's motorcycle, probably in an attempt to flee and save his life or alert the authorities to what was happening.
 
The bodies were found last morning and one of them corresponds to Exón Vélez, 27, located on a plot in the vicinity of his residence with several deep cuts, "apparently caused by a white weapon such as a machete," he explained to Efe. Diane Rodríguez, president of the Federation, which groups more than 40 groups across the country.
 
The other corpse, that of Vélez's partner, appeared lying in a pool of blood, also with several cuts and next to the motorcycle of his sentimental partner, presumably when trying to flee from his attackers, Rodríguez said.
 
The Psycho Trans Center of the Silhouette X Association learned the details of the event thanks to a member of the group in the area, who prefers to keep his identity hidden, as well as the relatives of the victims, for fear of reprisals.
 
At the moment, the motive for the event is unknown, although no theft of any belongings of the deceased has been reported, and LGBT organizations point out that it would have been carried out "by a group of people apparently from the locality . "
 
"We have asked for an investigation into the event that occurred to a couple and it seems that they have been issues of hatred because they have murdered both," Rodríguez insisted, raising the death victims of the LGBT collective in Ecuador to six so far this year.
 
The communiqué of the associations rejects "energetically" what happened in Buena Fe and demands that the authorities, especially the Prosecutor General's Office, carry out "the necessary investigations to find the culprits."
 
According to the statistics of the Silhouette X Association that prepares the Runa Sipiy report, in Ecuador there were 16 violent murders of members of the LGBT collective in 2019, of which 4 were homosexuals and 12 trans women.
