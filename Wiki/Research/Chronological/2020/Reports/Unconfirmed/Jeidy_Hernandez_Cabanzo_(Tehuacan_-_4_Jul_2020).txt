The Prosecutor General of Puebla obtained a link to the process against José Ángel Luis N and José Francisco N, for attempted murder against Jeidy Hernández Cabanzo.

On July 4, the mechanics shot Jeidy in the back, just for being a transgender woman.

In a press release, FGP reported that the investigation is for attempted murder of the woman.

The Prosecutor's Office also said –at a question from Political Animal- that the connection to the process of only two people is “because at the moment it is what works in the investigation folder and the legal results”.
