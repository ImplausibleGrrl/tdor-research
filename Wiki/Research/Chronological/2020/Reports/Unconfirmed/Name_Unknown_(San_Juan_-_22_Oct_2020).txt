A 23-year-old young man was admitted to prison today after a judge found him cause for arrest for having physically and emotionally mistreated his partner in the Israel neighborhood of Hato Rey, police reported.

Christian Ojeda Adorno was arrested last night in Toa Baja after allegedly carrying out a serious assault in the middle of an incident of domestic violence with his consensual partner, a transgender woman.

According to the investigation, while he was inside his vehicle, an argument arose with his partner and he attacked her, on several occasions, with fists and slaps on the face and different parts of the body.

In addition, he grabbed her tightly by the neck rendering her unconscious. Later, showing her a knife, he told her that “he was going to regret it,” thus subjecting her to a pattern of physical and emotional abuse.

The woman had to be transported in stable condition to a hospital institution.

Ojeda Adorno was charged with two charges for mistreatment under Law 54 on Domestic Violence and one charge for carrying and using knives under the Weapons Law.

Judge Raiza Cajigas Campbell, of the San Juan Court of First Instance, gave him a bond of $ 15 thousand. As the amount was not loaned, the man was admitted to the Bayamón jail.

The case was investigated by prosecutor Linnette Velázquez Grau, together with agent Flor I. Rivera Carrasquillo , from the San Juan Domestic Violence Division of the Police Bureau.
