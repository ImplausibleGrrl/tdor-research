A transvestite who was in a street situation, died on the public highway on 72 Poniente of the 20 de Noviembre neighborhood of the city of Puebla, after spending the whole night in a planter.

The events were reported on Tuesday morning when residents of this area realized that a person they had seen sitting in a planter on 72 Poniente since Monday afternoon was lying in the same place.

Alarmed, they notified the 911 emergency number, so elements of the Municipal Police of Puebla arrived at the point confirming that this person no longer had vital signs.

In order to verify this situation, SUMA paramedics assessed a man of approximately 35 years of age, with long hair and dressed as a woman, indicating that he did not show signs of violence.
