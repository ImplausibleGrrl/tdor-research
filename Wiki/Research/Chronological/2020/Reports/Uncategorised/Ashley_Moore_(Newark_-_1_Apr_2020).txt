Authorities in Newark, N.J., are reviewing the investigation of a Black transgender woman’s death that was ruled a suicide and have announced reforms in the wake of criticism over how the police handled the case.

Ashley Moore, 21, was found dead April 1 just outside the Newark YW/YMCA, where she had lived, Tap Into Newark reports. But her mother, Starlet Carbins, said police did not report Moore’s death to her, and she learned of it on Facebook nine days later.

Family members also questioned the ruling of suicide, as Moore had ligature and strangulation marks on her neck, according to the police report, and those could be signs of foul play. The family and LGBTQ+ advocates have called for further investigation.

Now the homicide unit of the Essex County Prosecutor’s Office will take another look at the circumstances of Moore’s death, officials there announced. And Newark Mayor Ras Baraka said the city will establish an LGBTQ+ hotline, to be operated through the Shani Baraka Women’s Resource Center, and will require police to contact local LGBTQ+ organizations and activists if they need additional information when investigating crimes against the community, such as help in identifying next of kin, under a new policy called the Ashley Moore Amendment. The city will also add an “LGBTQ” identity box to gender options on police reports, although Moore was correctly identified as a woman, Mayor Baraka said.

“I met with friends and supporters of Ms. Moore to offer condolences and apologies for the inexcusable amount of time it took for police to notify her mother of her death,” he said in a written statement, according to Tap Into Newark. “It was clear to me that once the family was located, there were gaps in communication between the police and Ms. Moore’s survivors, which left the family with many questions about the circumstances of her death. We must do better in timely notifications when next of kin are not readily known and give survivors composite detail regarding the death of their loved one.”

Police are finally investigating the death of a Black trans woman who was found dead in the street more than four months ago with horrifying injuries and cremated without an autopsy.

Chef Ashley Moore was just 26 years old when she was found dead outside the YMCA in Newark, New Jersey, just after 4 am on April 1.

Her mother, nurse Starlet Carbin, was never notified by police that her daughter had passed away. Instead, she had to find out via Facebook when she visited her daughter’s profile to wish her a happy birthday, nine days after she had died.

Interviewed by activist Jasmin Singer, Carbin said: “All the information I obtained I got on my own. No one contacted me to let me know my child was dead.”

When Carbin contacted authorities, she was first told by a Newark police detective that a doctor at the hospital Moore was transported to before she was pronounced dead said she had likely been hit by a car. Later, the same detective suggested she could have fallen from a great height.

Carbin said the police report, which she was allowed to finally access at the end of July, noted that there were ligature marks on Moore’s legs, she had suffered rectal bleeding and her neck was “grossly swollen and disfigured”.

As a trained nurse, Carbin said: “Going into what I know when I’m looking at a patient, the description that’s in that police report is not of someone who fell or was hit by a vehicle.”

The police report also states that a witness saw Moore running down, not up, the stairs of the YMCA before she was found outside.

Ashley Moore’s death was ‘mishandled completely’.
When Carbin discovered that the police department’s complete lack of action did not correlate with her daughter’s injuries, she contacted the executive director of the Newark LGBTQ Community Center, Beatrice Simpkins.

Simpkins got in touch with Newark Police Department, and requested that they review traffic camera footage to see if the young trans woman had in fact been hit by a car. The footage showed that no traffic accident had taken place.

Interviewed alongside Carbin, Simpkins said: “It was mishandled completely and to me, it continues to be mishandled.

“Even after the discovery of the film, there hasn’t been a lot of followup.

“Part of this is because of the fact that Ashley is a Black trans woman, whose lives are not seen as valuable or worth the attention that someone else’s life may be worth.

“The institutional attitude was, ‘well, just another dead Black kid on the street’.”


Authorities are investigating the April death of a Newark trans woman after months calls for action by activists and community members, authorities announced Tuesday.

Ashley Moore's death had been ruled a suicide after she was found unresponsive lying on the sidewalk in front of the YMCA on Broad Street around 4:10 a.m. April 1, Newark Public Safety Director Anthony F. Ambrose said.

Moore, 26, was taken to University Hospital where she was pronounced dead.

"To date, our detectives have not discovered evidence to the contrary," Ambrose said. "However, I have reached out to Essex County Prosecutor Theodore Stephens and requested a review of Ms. Moore’s death by the county’s Homicide Task Force."

Moore's mother, Starlet Carbin, told Out.com the story she was told by police changed multiple times.

Carbin says she was told her daughter sustained injuries after falling a great distance and at another point that Moore was hit by a car, the report says.

The police report stated that there were "ligature marks on Ashley's legs, and that Ashley's neck was grossly, grotesquely disfigured and swollen." Carbin said.



Ashley Moore was a 26-year-old Black trans woman who was found dead on the streets in Newark, NJ in April 2020. She had strangle marks on her neck, but there was no police investigation.

You've probably never heard of her. Ashley's death was pushed under the rug by an inept police force that didn't provide any investigation, nor did they reach out to Ashley's mother, Starlet Carbin.

Starlet found out about her daughter's death when she went to her Facebook page to wish her a happy birthday. That's when her world fell apart.

It would be many more months before Starlet would receive a police report, and she has yet to receive a coroner's report.

To date, there has not been an investigation.

The police report she eventually received included information indicating there were gruesome strangle marks on Ashley's neck.

Yet there was no investigation.

The police originally told Starlet that her daughter had likely been hit by a car. Yet there was zero evidence of that, and the police report itself didn't match that determination.

The Newark LGBTQ Center—led by Beatrice Simpkins—stepped in in June 2020.

The video below includes a discussion among Starlet, Beatrice, and activist Jasmin Singer (who Starlet originally reached out when she was getting no other answers), and details the case, and the current needs.

Ashley Moore was misgendered in the police report.

Ashley Moore was treated as if she didn't matter.

As if Black lives DON'T matter.

Ashley matters, and finding some justice in this horrid case matters, too.

Our current needs are:

» The Newark LGBTQ Center needs a legal fund for Ashley's case so that there's an investigation, and for the other cases that they deal with each day surrounding violent and inhumane acts pointed toward the LGBTQ community—especially trans women and men of color. This GoFundMe campaign was set up to create a retainer so that a lawyer can be hired and help us find justice for Ashley. Please donate if you can, and spread the word.

» We need to generate media about this ... a lot of media. So please help us by emailing and tweeting journalists and helping us reach the press with this story.

» We need public awareness about Ashley's story, so please share this with your social media followings, your email lists, and get it in the hands of anyone you know with major platforms.

We will update this with further needs as they become apparent.
