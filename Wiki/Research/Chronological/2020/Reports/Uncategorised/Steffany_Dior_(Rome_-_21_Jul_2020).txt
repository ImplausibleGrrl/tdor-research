The autopsy, which is crucial in this case as never before, will determine whether the testimony of a 43-year-old is true or not. Doubts that only medical science and the investigations that will ensue will unravel. What is certain is that a transsexual was found dead in Rome, between Piazzale Pino Pascali and Viale Palmiro Togliatti, near the ex Slaughterhouse. 

Found trans dead in Rome
It is 10 pm on Tuesday 21 July when, at the Single Emergency Number, a phone call arrives: " I hit a person on the street. I stopped. She was already dead though, it was dark. I didn't see her ", she hears other part from the appliance.

The carabinieri of Tor Sapienza and those of the Investigative Unit in via In Selci immediately arrived at the place indicated. With them also the 118 medical staff who could not help but confirm the death of the person poured on the asphalt. 

Beside her is a blonde wig. To identify the victim, shortly thereafter, it was the carabinieri certifying that the body was of a 36 year old Brazilian transsexual. 


A trans woman was found lifeless last night in Rome, between Piazzale Pino Pascali and Viale Palmiro Togliatti, in the Tor Sapienza district. To give the alarm to the Single Emergency Number, a call in which an alarmed voice declared that he had hit the woman, but that he had doubts that the body was actually lifeless at the moment of impact.

Once they arrived at the place indicated, both the 118 staff and the Carabinieri Investigation Unit could not help but ascertain the death of the victim. The body will undergo an autopsy, to determine the cause of death, verify that there are no other signs of violence other than those of the impact with the car and, above all, evaluate whether it was alive or not at the time of the accident. According to investigative sources, in fact, the woman's body was already cold when the carabinieri arrived at the place where the corpse was located, so the investigations are still open.

Also in Rome, the body of a trans woman was found under a mattress on the banks of the Tiber last February , while a few weeks ago another transgender person threatened to commit suicide at the Eur station after being attacked.

It cannot be excluded that the woman found dead yesterday in Tor Sapienza was the victim of transphobia, as underlined by Francesco Angeli, president of Arcigay Rome. "Italy holds the sad primacy in Europe of murders due to transphobic hatred - declares the activist - The many victims of recent years make us think about how much the issue of security and isolation of trans people in our country is totally outside from the interest of politics, which should represent everyone ».



The body of a Brazilian transsexual was found in a neighborhood on the outskirts of Rome, capital of Italy, on Tuesday night (21).

This is already the second case of a trans woman from Brazil found dead in the European country just this week. According to sources linked to the investigation, the victim was 36 years old .... Click on the photo and find out more!

The body was lying in the darkest corner of the Prenestino stretch. Next to her, the blonde wig, her handbag and the obvious signs of a car accident. The discovery of the young transsexual, found lifeless in Piazzale Pino Pascali, a few steps from Palmiro Togliatti, around 10 pm on Tuesday is shrouded in mystery. Homeless - her name is Alessandro Santos de Araujo - the 36-year-old Brazilian woman had a difficult life behind her on the sex streets of the capital."Come, I ran her over but I swear she was already dead": it was a 43-year-old compatriot who raised the alarm, called 112 excitedly to self-report. Shortly before, on board her Citroen, she had hit her friend's body, then in shock she stopped to rescue her. But there was nothing more for the victim to do.

When the carabinieri arrived on the scene, the investigations and findings on the trans took place, however complicated by the impact with the car. According to what was rebuilt by the military of Tor Sapienza and the investigative unit in via In Selci, the 43-year-old would not be involved in the mystery . The trans was perhaps looking for a secluded place with a client, or maybe she was looking for a colleague to spend the evening with: few details told so far by what is considered by the investigators to be a key witness and not a possible suspect. The two had known each other, worked in the same area for some time and the transsexual community has always been very close. Therefore, no driver-related elements emerged. Instead there is to reconstruct the evening of the victim and, above all,the exact causes of the death have to be ascertained because, according to the first findings, it would be prior to the investment. Many injuries and fractures were evident on the victim's body, compatible with the violent collision with the car, but it cannot be excluded at the moment that some of the lacerations is rather connected to an assault which proved to be fatal.


An episode of transphobia, a punitive expedition or a meeting with a client who ended up in tragedy? The carabinieri still have too little to work on to rule out some hypotheses. We are also looking for images of possible video surveillance systems in the area which, perhaps, could help to reconstruct the last hours of life of the 36-year-old or even to identify suspects of passage in the area where the body was found. The decisive help to the investigations can come from the autoptic examination, already ordered by the substitute prosecutor Alessandra D'Amore: only the clinical outcomes will be able to determine if Alessandro's was a murder . It is in fact possible that the transsexual died due to a sudden illness.
