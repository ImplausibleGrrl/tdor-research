Gabriela Soria died: "Trans are like glitter, so when they leave they have to shine"
December 14, 2020

Gabriela “La Chava” Soria , a historical trans from the province, died last week . His health was seriously deteriorating. Social networks were filled with messages, photos and goodbyes for the woman who did not go unnoticed and fought for her rights.

"Trotabarrios from Villa 9 de Julio to the south, from the streets to the Deliberative Council, with the overwhelming irreverence and the fantastic correct political incorrectness so characteristic of the Trans Tucuman Collective that earned him friendships and admiration as well as fights", wrote Galo Esquidé after his death.

Recently, "La Chava" was present during the session of the Deliberative Council of San Miguel de Tucumán , when the Trans Labor Quota ordinance was approved . This claim seeks to repair a structural inequality that exists in society with respect to the trans transvestite population. "La Chava" was no stranger to the harshness that hit transvestite bodies.

"Her health was already very deteriorated as a result of the sanitary vulnerabilities that also characterize us and having had to resort to precarious health treatments, but she tried to prevent many colleagues from reaching that point, " continues Galo's story.

“ There remains the sadness of the talks we had planned, the anger of the State being late again, there are also the smiles of that noon for the Labor Quota won in the Municipality and the gratitude for the teachings that wanting and unintentionally are still marking me ".

Gabi was dressed in a blue dress with silver sequins for the wake. A friend of hers recalled that it's okay to be like this. "Trans are like glitter, so when they leave they have to shine."




Today, Friday, December 11, we mourn the death of another Trans, Travesti, Transgender, 52-year-old colleague from Ciudad de Tafi Viejo (Tucumán).
