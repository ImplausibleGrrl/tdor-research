Elie was found in an unresponsive state on Orchard Beach in the Bronx on the morning of Monday 31st August. Police and local media repeatedly deadnamed her.

> A 23-year-old woman that police say was found dead at Orchard Beach in the Bronx on the morning on August 31 was transgender, according to news reports as well as to the confused manner in which the NYPD described its discovery of the death.
> 
> Police found the woman unconscious and unresponsive in the sand near Orchard Beach Road and Park Drive at approximately 6:09 a.m. EMS responders arrived shortly thereafter and pronounced her dead.
>
> There are very few additional details surrounding the circumstances of the individual’s death. An investigation is underway and the NYPD is awaiting a cause of death from the medical examiner. Gay City News has contacted the medical examiner to seek further updates when they become available.
> 
> Police identified the individual as a woman but appeared to deadname her with a male first name in an email. Gay City News does not have confirmed information about the name by which she identified herself. She resided in Manhattan at 306 West 139 Street, according to the NYPD. The police did not immediately respond to an email seeking clarification about the individual’s gender identity, but NBC New York reported that she was a transgender woman.
