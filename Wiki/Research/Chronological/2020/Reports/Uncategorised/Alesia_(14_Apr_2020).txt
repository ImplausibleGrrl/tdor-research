Last April 14, the Spazio Bianco Association of Perugia posted a poster to greet Alessia, a transgender woman who died a few days ago in the Umbrian capital at just 30 years of age due to a serious illness, which lasted two years, and denounced her abandonment from his family.

«An example for his strength in enduring, forgiving and continuing to dream - says the poster that was photographed and went viral on Facebook - A heartfelt thanks and a note of particular esteem to all the medical and paramedical staff of the Clinic of Diseases Infectious, Oncology and Hospice for palliative care that accepted, cared for and loved it so as to make it feel at home ».

From what emerges from the story of her friends, Alessia, originally from Pompeii, would have been abandoned twice, first by her native parents and subsequently by her adoptive parents, who did not accept the nature of their daughter, who did not identify with the gender assigned to her birth and had embarked on a transition path.

Many greeted Alessia on social media. «I met this girl in hospital at the end of her ordeal - writes a social-health worker from the Silvestrini hospital in Perugia - A strong, very sweet person, with a unique sympathy. I hope this photo and this accusation will turn and reach its "family members", those who have abandoned it ».

Even Daniela Lourdes Falanga, president of Arcigay Antinoo of Naples, remembers her in a Facebook post : «I met her for the first time on February 2 a few years ago by Mamma Schiavona , to celebrate and rejoice in that body that made her a woman, of the her beauty, of that desire which then led her to meet me and Ilario Arena ( also an activist of the association, ed ) first in Pompeii, then in Naples, where he asked me to accompany her on her transition path. A path that made her happy, an address to life as she was supposed to represent it ».

Unfortunately, Alessia was deprived of her identity, the one she had fought so hard for, even when she was dead. In fact, his family posted other posters, in which he is referred to as "mister" and called by his deadname.

«You have been generous, and now I cry you, and I even cry the death denied in peace, with the name you had chosen, to reproduce" correct ", in the masculine, as if it were nothing of you - comments Daniela - We remind you how you really were . We are close to you. Rest in peace".
