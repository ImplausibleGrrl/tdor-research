Trans woman dies in hotel room in Mérida - Mexico News
09/06/2020
Alerted by his absence and by a fetid smell, employees of a hotel in Mérida found a dead woman inside a room

Data given to Semefo staff indicates that for a couple of days the absence of one of the guests at the Hotel Villas de la Rosa y el Rey, located on Itzaes avenue in Mérida, was notorious.

The manager of the establishment, when passing through the door of one of the rooms, noticed a strong rotten smell.

With the master key he opened the room finding a terrible scene: the body of the room's tenant was lifeless, she had a mask on.

It was about an individual named Gerardo FM but who in his daily life and because of his transgender condition, called himself Guadalupe Geraldine, approximately 60 years old.

The forensic medical service was in charge of removing the body. Appropriate infection control precautions were applied since it is not known whether she died of Covid-19 or because of another disease.

Nor has it been determined whether the woman in question had relatives, since she lived alone in the aforementioned hotel, for a long time.
