A 34-year-old girl was murdered yesterday in the neighboring province of Tucumán. Her name was Alejandra “Power” Benítez. Alejandra had recently fired Pato Lizárraga, a young trans woman from Tucuman, who died in Córdoba on October 28. His environment qualifies his death as "doubtful" and asks that it be investigated.

Yesterday we found the sad news of the death of comrade Pato Lizarraga. Transformist and sex worker.

In the midst of a doubtful death, one more death fills us with pain, another death of a companion who undoubtedly in one way or another suffered many of the violence that trans and transvestites suffer from day to day.

From the House of Pride we make ourselves available to whatever is necessary so that the facts can be clarified and that her family can meet her and thus rest in peace.

We will continue fighting as every day so that we do not have to mourn any more deaths of our comrades.
