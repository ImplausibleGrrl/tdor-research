Death won the battle against ex-politician Carolina, a trans woman whose first name is Augusto Antonio Gutiérrez Mercado. This morning, his family members begged for the help of a doctor to assess his health. They had no financial resources and so they insisted that a doctor come to see her at her home in Diriamba, where she gave her last breath at six in the afternoon.

«Augustus no longer needs a doctor. Augusto just passed away at six in the afternoon, he just died. We no longer want a doctor, when we looked for him it was too late for him, "said his sister Scarleth Díaz Mercado, by telephone.

Since the morning, Carolina was in poor health, had anemia and was weak, had lost a lot of weight. She spent lying in her bed all day, after a while she could sit down. Her feet were swollen and all she wanted was for a doctor to take pity on her and go to her home to treat her.

It is very bad. Right now what you need is a doctor. People help with food, but what they need is a doctor, ”his sister Scarleth Díaz Mercado said this morning by telephone. He was born under the name of Augusto Antonio and decided to join the civic struggle in April 2018 in Diriamba, a municipality in the department of Carazo.

A few weeks ago he was a few days at the Manolo Morales Hospital. There he was diagnosed with advanced anemia. "He does not have much of having been in the Manolo Morales hospital, they put blood on him, he was there for about five days and he relapsed," added his sister early.

Scarleth and her mother, Noa Luz Mercado Parrales, spent the foot of her bed as many times as necessary, praying to God for her speedy recovery. «He is given chicken soup, but he returns it (vomits). He spends all day in bed, he can no longer stop. He complains a lot, he says his ribs hurt, he also gets tired. His body hurts and the pit of his stomach, his feet are swollen, "said the sister.

Carolina, 35 years old, was released on May 20, 2019, after 10 months in prison. It was under the figure of family coexistence.

He used to sell enchiladas, but now he can't. He has relapsed twice. He no longer wants to go to the hospital, what he wants is for a doctor to come see him at home. We were looking for a doctor in Diriamba but he did not want to come. We do not have the resources to pay a private doctor, so we appeal to a doctor's charity, ”said Scarleth.

For now, in addition to chicken soup, it required vitaminized milk, which for the family was not easy to obtain due to lack of resources. They also needed pampers, so they appealed to the solidarity of the people. Maybe people can help us. You also need vitamins and iron. Yesterday, about four in the morning, we looked at him badly, he rolled his eyes, "said Scarleth in the morning.

Scarleth added that she had faith that her brother was recovering. "Only God can do the work of making me live longer. We have faith.

Beatings and threats of rape: the "double punishment" of trans women in Daniel Ortega's prisons
They kidnapped her on July 9, 2018, in the city of Diriamba, located 40 kilometers from Managua. That morning a mob of armed civilians violently entered the home of  Kysha Lopéz , 29, who was in the company of her partner  Eddy Gertrudis González .

They beat González to almost kill him, ransacked the house, undressed Kysha, groped her, and thus took her to a police station in the department of Carazo. After questioning her, she was taken to the Directorate of Judicial Aid in Managua, better known as  El Chipote , a detention center that has been designated by national and international human rights organizations as " a torture prison .

Kysha López is a  transgender woman . She was engaged in the sale of beauty products, household appliances and was a lender. Her legal name is Richard Sebastián López, but at 18 she decided to assume the identity of Kysha.
She was  accused of financing the lifting of road blocks,  known as "tranques" during protests against President Daniel Ortega in 2018. She was also accused of burning a police station and looting the Diriamba mayor's office.

Kysha was one of the three transgender women who suffered discrimination, physical and sexual violence in the Jorge Navarro National Penitentiary System, known as La Modelo. Located in the municipality of Tipitapa, 22 kilometers from the capital.

The feminist activist María Teresa Blandón denounced the " double violation of the human rights of these women ", since in the State of Nicaragua there is no gender identity law that recognizes or protects trans women.

The second of the transgender women who suffered in the prisons of the Ortega regime was  Victoria Obando Valverde , a young university student who had been imprisoned for 28 years.

When the April protests broke out, Victoria Obando  was part of the university students who took the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua (UNAM), as a pressure measure for Daniel Ortega to leave power.

The young woman with long black hair left her makeup, heels and dresses to put on pants and set up barricades to protect herself from attacks by the police and para-police groups.

In August 2018, Victoria Obando was captured by police officers in the city of León, 95 kilometers from Managua, along with other student leaders after participating in a demonstration against Ortega.
"The girls were mistreated more, they are different and the mere fact of going to the same bathroom as the men is something that bothers them, but they tell me that the prisoners have mostly respected them," recalls Yolanda Valverde, mother. from Obando.

Victoria,  like most political prisoners of the Ortega dictatorship, was accused of terrorism, murder and crimes against the Nicaraguan State.

On July 9 and in the same city of Diriamba, while Kysha López was taken naked to the police cells, Carolina Gutiérrez,  the third of the trans women kidnapped during the protests, was beaten at the other end of the city  .

His legal name is Augusto Antonio Gutiérrez Mercado. Such was the beating he received from the paramilitaries that he lost three teeth.
In La Modelo they knew her as "Sexi Carolina" and as soon as she got to prison she was greeted by prison officers with  a brutal beating.

Kysha, Victoria and Carolina were found in La Modelo prison . As the only trans women in the entire prison, they decided to support each other to resist discrimination inside the prison.

Juanita Urbina, a transgender activist, says that in the prisons of the Ortega regime,  organizations defending the LGBT community managed to count more than nine imprisoned sexual diversity activists.

" We know that there were more, but many of them hid their sexual condition to avoid worse treatment ," says the human rights defender.

In November 2018, Victoria Obando managed to filter a letter from prison recounting the abuse she suffered in La Modelo.

" Kysha, Carolina and Victoria, transgender political prisoners, go out to the patio twice a week, only for 25 minutes, when they return to the cells, the officers await them, forcing them to undress in front of their cellmates ," he wrote. Victory.

For her part, Kysha recounted in the visits she received from her relatives that they often received threats of rape, and that she was constantly stripped naked to tamper with or exhibit her in front of other inmates and prison officials.

Kysha relates that a few days after her arrest, she was almost raped by an officer, but that he repented and did not commit the rape. «An officer had an order to put a gentle bowling (tonfa) in my anus. Thank God that man took pity. He said to me: I pretended that I raped you please », related the now released prisoner.

Kysha López was sentenced to 41 years in prison for crimes of terrorism and terrorist financing , of which she was detained for ten months in gallery 16-1 in the La Modelo Penitentiary System.  She was released on May 20, 2019. She is currently trying to get out of the debts she has after she lost everything when she was kidnapped.

That same day Carolina was released from prison. Currently, he is receiving medical and psychological assistance and is  trying to recover the sight of one of his eyes, since the retina was detached from the beatings he received and he has lost almost all visibility.

Although Carolina maintains "that she will continue to fight against the dictatorship of Daniel Ortega", she has kept a low profile to take care of her life.

Victoria Obando Valverde was the last trans prisoner to be released on June 10, 2019 . Unlike other political prisoners, Obando was released under an amnesty law created by the Daniel Ortega regime on June 8, 2019, along with other social and peasant leaders who opposed the Ortega regime during the strongest months of repression.

Since her release from prison, Victoria has continued to carry out activism against the Daniel Ortega dictatorship and is currently in Geneva, Switzerland where she participates in the sessions of the United Nations Human Rights Council to denounce the violations she suffered along with other political prisoners in the regime's jails.
