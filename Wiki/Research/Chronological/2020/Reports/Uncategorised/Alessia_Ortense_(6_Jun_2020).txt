Luxuria: "It is a lack of pietas and it is the denial of the dignity of those people who do not choose to live in an identity other than that of birth out of spite, but because they do not feel in that gender identity"

After Alessia Cirillo another transgender woman, who died at a young age, was indicated on the mortuary posters with the male registry name . This is the 46-year-old Alessia Ortense , who died today at the Pescara Civic Hospital.

To give the news with a post of condemnation Giovanna Giò Sensation , delegate organizer for Abruzzo of Miss Trans Italia, who in Gaynews said: «I learned of the death of this trans girl from Pescara, who was not a friend of mine, but a simple knowledge. Being aware of its existence, I marveled at the male name on the posters . In fact, the male name of Alessia was put on the obituaries, while Alessia is the name by which I met her in Pescara.

I can understand the pain and discomfort of the parents right now. I can also understand that this is a very delicate moment, but it would have been right at least to add the girl's chosen name to the "registry" name , or they could put it in brackets or they could write "called Alessia". I don't want to criticize parents or relatives because I can understand the pain of losing them. However, I wanted to draw attention to what happened, because, having also been president of a trans-local association, I would like trans people to continue to be considered, even after death, for how they wanted to be in life ".

Always echoed on Facebook Daniela Lourdes Falanga , president of Arcigay Antinoo Napoli, who wrote «Giovanna Gio Miscia reports another case of unrecognition to the life of a trans woman. After Alessia, after Valentina, after who knows how many and how many invisible *, still the macabre use of selfishness in total denial of existence. Thus a woman becomes a man again in the silence of death. I hope for a path of awareness of the family ».
