The State Attorney General's Office took several hours to deliver the activist's body, because it did not recognize the documents that showed her change in gender identity, explained Rosalía López Castro, a member of the Violeta Lawyers Network.

Mérida, Yucatán, October 26, 2020.- The transgender activist Patsy España Chan has been discriminated against even after her death: the State Attorney General's Office (FGE) took several hours to deliver her body to her family, as she did not recognize the documents stating your gender identity change.

Due to the fact that local legislation does not allow this procedure to be carried out, España Chan made its gender identity change a few years ago in Mexico City. The authority of that entity issued her birth certificate and voter ID, that is, she had official papers that proved her new identity.

After his death, the family went to the FGE to recover the body, but the agency was reluctant to hand it over, because it did not recognize the documents issued in the country's capital, explained Rosalía López Castro, a political scientist who is a member of the Violeta Lawyers Network and advisor. activist policy.

“The FGE did not want to give the body, because in the local Civil Registry they did not have a record that said 'Patsy España Chan'. The documents from Mexico City did not want to make them valid, they did not want to acknowledge this process, ”the specialist explained.

According to López Castro, the agency even issued a special search order to find the activist's birth certificate with her previous identity. Several people had to intervene, including civil servants and legal advisers, and finally the body was delivered, with the death certificate corresponding to Patsy's identity.

The political scientist described this action as discriminatory, in addition to being institutional violence, because although they had official papers, the activist's relatives carried out various procedures with documents that have long lost validity, to "find an act that did not exist." and recover the body.

Therefore, as soon as the days of mourning for the family pass, different civil associations will issue a statement demanding an end to institutional violence against the Yucatecan trans community, said López Castro.

As reported in the Fracto Report, Spain Chan died yesterday in a road accident, just after being appointed Territorial and Affiliation Coordinator of the Labor Party in District XIII.

The activist, who in her lifetime fought for the defense of the rights and political participation of the LGBTTTI + community, aspired to be a candidate for the local council of the aforementioned constituency, with which she would have become one of the few trans people who have competed for a political position. 




Mérida, Yucatán, October 25, 2020.- Patsy España Chan, a Yucatecan transgender activist, known for promoting the political participation of the LGBTTTI + community, lost her life this afternoon in a sinister road.

Apparently, she was traveling as a passenger aboard a Tsuru, which was hit by a truck on the Muna-Maxcanú highway, Opichén-Calcetok section. The driver of the vehicle was also killed in the incident and the passengers of the van were injured.  

Spain Chan, a native of Halachado, chaired the YuCamQroo Peninsular Collective “Xkich Paan Ko'olel Trans” and focused on defending the rights of the LGBTTTI + population in the political sphere.

During the 2018 electoral process, he participated, along with representatives of local and national associations, in the elaboration of an agenda with proposals in favor of the rights of sexual diversity, which was sent to the candidates for 3,400 positions of popular representation in the country.

He carried out the same exercise at the state level, with Yucatecan groups, in which he insisted on the need to approve the law that would allow the change of gender identity in the entity, since those who want to do so have to travel to Mexico City, which it is expensive and complicated.
