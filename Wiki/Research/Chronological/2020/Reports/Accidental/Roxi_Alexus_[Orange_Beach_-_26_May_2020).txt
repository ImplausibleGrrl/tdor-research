Jasmine Brundy, a 28-year-old pharmacy technician from Chalmette, was pronounced dead early Thursday evening, according to members of the family.

Roxi Alexus, 28, and her boyfriend, Darius Robinson were with Brundy on May 24 when all three of them drowned while swimming in the Perdido Pass area, according to the Coast Guard and NBC 15. Brundy was found face down in the water by a Good Samaritan boat and later brought to EMS.

Family members tell WDSU they’re not sure of how long she was in the water before being rescued. She was taken off life support Thursday at Sacred Heart in Pensacola.

Family and friends of Alexus, a well-known hairstylist, gathered at her salon on Downman Road in New Orleans East for a balloon release and vigil Thursday night.




The U.S. Coast Guard found two bodies Tuesday off the coast of Alabama, in the proximity to where two swimmers from New Orleans had been reported disappeared.

The two bodies were found around 5:30 a.m. along the Gulf Shores in Baldwin County, Alabama. The first body washed up near Gulf State Park while the second was found shortly after near a local road. The bodies’ discovery comes after two days of searching by the Coast Guard and police for the two swimmers that reportedly got pulled out into open water.

Darius Robinson, 22, and Ryan Guy, 28, were last seen around 5:30 p.m. on Sunday swimming along Perdido Pass, just east of where the bodies were found.

Police said witnesses called around 5:50 p.m. after seeing three swimmers struggling against the strong surf along the beach. While Robinson and Guy went missing, the third swimmer was rescued by a passing boater. The swimmer was identified as Jasmine Brundy, 28, of Chalmette, Louisiana, and was taken to a hospital in Pensacola, Florida, where she remains in critical condition.

Authorities have not confirmed if the bodies found are Robinson and Guy and have not called off searches along the Alabama coastline, which has been assisted by Orange Beach police and fire departments, as well as Baldwin County Beach Patrol.

ORANGE BEACH, Fl. (WVUE) - The Coast Guard is currently searching for two missing New Orleans residents who were last seen swimming near Orange Beach Sunday.

The Coast Guard were called just before 6 p.m. for three people in distress who were swimming near Perdido Pass.

One swimmer, who has been identified as 28-year-old Jasmine Brundy of Chalmette, was located and rescued by a good Samaritan who was in a boat nearby. She was taken to an area hospital where her condition is currently unknown.

“I feel like, if they found Jasmine, they are going to find Roxi,” said Roxi’s sister Erica Burton. “Until we get a body, there’s hope. There’s hope.”

A search continues for the other two swimmers from New Orleans who are identified as 28-year-old Ryan Guy, who identifies as Roxi, and 22-year-old Darius Robinson.

Guy’s sisters say they’re overwhelmed with uncertainty and simply want closure.

“Of course you know how I feel right now. That’s my baby. That’s my baby. And I can’t take it,” cried Roxi’s oldest sister Tiffany Guy. “I just want y’all to at least find her. Find her!”

Tiffany says her sister is a strong swimmer but knows better than to go far out into the ocean. A kind and generous person, she think Roxi and thinks she might have been trying to help Darius.
