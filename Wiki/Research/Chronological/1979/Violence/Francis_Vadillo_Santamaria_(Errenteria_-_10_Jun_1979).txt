> At dawn on June 10, 1979, Antonio Caba Laguna, a national police officer out of service, entered the Renteria Apolo club in a state of notorious drunkenness. Suddenly, the policeman took out his regulation weapon and killed Vicente Vadillo Santamaría, known in the environment as 'Francis', from a shot in the face.
> 
> The next day, the local press quit the murder and some newspaper as the 'ABC' entitled 'Transvestite killed in a club by the shot of a policeman'. The text implied that the police officer accidentally fired his gun, although at the trial held four years later, in 1983, witnesses claimed that the agent threatened the manager of the club, at which time 'Francis' said " And why do not you shoot me? ", At which point, Antonio Caba turned and fired at Vicente's face, who fell instantly dead.
> 
> Those were the years of lead in Euskadi. Rentería was a battlefield between ETA and the police forces, and the assassin, who had been incorporated for four days to his new destination, "came wanting to kill a Basque", according to Mikel Martin, of the Gay Liberation Movement (EHGAM). ), in an interview with Berria.
> 
> However, Vicente Vadillo was not Basque, but Valencian, born in Torrent, where his corpse was buried days later.
> 
> That tragic event gave an unexpected impulse to the movement of the rights of homosexuals in the Basque Country, until then in secrecy and marginality. It was not for less, according to the insidious law in force at the time, and that was not repealed until 1988, a homosexual could be sentenced to 5 years in prison for the mere fact of being.
> 
> The death of Francis led to the birth of the first manifestations of the gay and lesbian collective in Guipúzcoa. The day after the murder, a protest demonstration is organized that arrives at the National Police barracks in Rentería. The protest is dissolved by blows and blows, but fear has been lost. On June 12 a large demonstration is organized in San Sebastián, the first one that makes visible the gay and lesbian group grouped around EHGAM in Guipúzcoa and consolidates the presence of EHGAM in the Basque Country. "It seems like a lie, but it gave us a big boost," recalls Mikel Martín in the interview.
> 
> Antonio Caba (now called "Antonio Cobo", according to this El País cut) was tried in 1983 by the Provincial Court of San Sebastián. The fiscl requested six years of prison for the defendant for "reckless imprudence", while the defense requested the punishment of six months for the same crime, reckless imprudence. The murderer was sentenced to nine months, but never entered prison. "It was horrible, we could not appeal," recalls Martin.
