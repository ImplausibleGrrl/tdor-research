Toronto Police believe that Cassandra Tula Do was murdered by a man as he raped her. The cause of her death is listed as strangulation. They base this belief on a similar attack months later in which the victim survived and the same DNA was found at the crime scene.

‘Shemale’ is 34th murder
Transgender escort strangled in apartment

The murder of a “shemale” escort in her downtown apartment has friends and fellow escorts fearful they may be next. Cassandra Do, 32, of Toronto, known as Tula on the street, was found dead in her 11th-floor home on Gloucester St. on Monday at 10:30 p.m. by horrified relatives after failing to hear from her. An autopsy yesterday revealed Do had been strangled.

“I just can’t believe it,” said Tasha Jones, a transgender friend and former escort. “That’s why I don’t do what she did anymore. It just got too scary.”

Jones is suggesting the transgender escort community come together and look out for each other when working.

“It could have been one of us. We need to bond and stick together,” she said. “Being a transsexual is sometimes very lonely. We really can’t trust a lot of people.”

Jones said Do lived a reclusive life and only let a select few know her real identity and background, adding she was well-liked and well-known by others in the business, but only as Tula.

“I didn’t even know her real name,” Jones said, her voice breaking with emotion.

Do, the city’s 34th homicide victim of the year, used to turn tricks out of her apartment and advertised on the Internet using the Web site www.shemaletula.com. She also advertised in local community papers.

Another fellow escort, who asked not to be named, said she was in a state of disbelief when she heard about Do’s death.

“I still can’t accept it,” she said, adding Do was a loner.

“She was a very private person. All I really knew about her is that she loved cats.”

Her brother was visiting her at the time of her death, but police wouldn’t confirm if he was the one who found her. Friends are planning a memorial service.

TORONTO, Sat, Nov 29/2003

A Trans woman was sexually assaulted by a client matching the description of Cassandra Tula Do`s murderer. It was an incall at her place in the Parkdale area at about 2 am. He got her number from her ad in an EYE magazine edition from last August. She hadn`t advertised since August. At the beginning of the date he seemed fine, though he wasn`t interested in foreplay. He then got rougher and began choking her. She managed to push him off of her and she got up to get something from behind the curtains. He lunged at her. She then told him that the camera on her dresser was recording everything. He stopped immediately and apologized. He got dressed and left but not before stealing a substantial amount of money from her purse. An interesting detail is that he removed the condom he was wearing and took it with him. Also he was completely shaven.

Det.-Sgt. Craig Sanson from Toronto Police is asking anyone with information on Do’s final hours to call 416-808-7400 or Crime Stoppers at 416-222-TIPS (8477).

For the second time in less than a week, a transgender woman was brutally 
killed in Washington D.C. on Thursday.

Police found the victim's partially nude body in a field early Thursday 
morning, the Associated Press reported. The victim, Imani Williams, had been 
shot but also had severe head wounds.

Hours earlier, another transgender woman, Punani Walker, was shot in 
Washington and had to be hospitalised in critical condition. Police 
reportedly said the two attacks were not related.

No arrests have been made in the two incidents.

On Saturday, transgender performer Bella Evangelista was fatally shot in 
what police are investigating as a potential hate crime. A suspect for the 
shooting is in custody.

The Washington-based Human Rights Campaign (HRC), the nation's largest GLBT 
rights advocacy group, mourned the killings.

"No person should live in fear of being attacked just because of who they 
are," Elizabeth Birch, HRC's executive director, said in a statement. "These 
hate crimes are vicious reminders of the work left to be done in ensuring 
the safety of every member of the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender 
community."

"In a year where 12 individuals have reportedly lost their lives to 
anti-transgender violence in the United States of America," Gwen Smith, 
founder of the Remembering Our Dead Project, said, "it is astounding that we 
have yet to see national hate crimes protections inclusive of gender 
identity."

One year ago, two Washington-area transgender teens were shot multiple times 
while sitting in a parked car. The killings remain unsolved, despite a 
$50,000 reward.

Imani Williams, 24
Emonie Kiera Spaulding, 25
Both 21 Aug 2003. Imani is not on the TDoR list.

In the past decade in Washington seven people were murdered, or died, as a result of someone else’s wrongdoing because they were transgender. And those are just the ones that were reported.

A new analysis from the Gender Public Advocacy Coalition (GenderPAC) titled 50 Under 30: Masculinity and the War on America’s Youth, reminds us who they were.

It also profiles the deaths of 43 other transgender people from around the nation, between the ages of 13 and 30, and ranks the District of Colombia as the city with the highest number of reported incidents.

Those who were killed in Washington include Imani Williams, 24, an African-American transgender woman who was found beaten and shot to death on Aug. 21, 2003. Her murder remains unsolved.

Emonie Kiera Spaulding, 25, was also killed that day. She was an African-American transgender sex worker who was shot to death when her assailant discovered that she was biologically male. Her killer, Derrick A. Lewis, 23, pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and was sentenced to 10 years in jail.

Bella Evangelista was shot and killed just a few days before those murders, on Aug. 16, 2003. The 25-year-old transgender Latina’s assailant was sentenced to 17 years in prison after he confessed to the killing and was convicted of second-degree murder.

One year prior to those murders, Ukea Davis, 18, and her friend, Stephanie Thomas, 19, were shot repeatedly by an assailant in a passing car as they sat in a car near Thomas’s house, in the early hours of Aug. 12, 2002. According to the report, the assailant then returned to the victims’ car on foot to deliver a second round of gunfire. Their murders remain unsolved.

Tyra Henderson was a 22-year-old African-American transgender woman involved in sex work. She was bludgeoned to death on April 23, 2000. Her case also remains unsolved.

Tyra Hunter wasn’t murdered, but many activists argue that her death could have been prevented. The 24-year-old died as a result of severe injuries she suffered from a car accident in Southeast in Aug. 1995. Paramedics wasted two-to-five minutes when they discovered she had male genitalia and interrupted her medical recovery to mock her instead, witnesses said.

Those seven deaths make Washington the highest ranked city for transgender murders within the past 10 years. Houston follows in second place with four incidents, and New York City is third with three.

”D.C.’s rate being the highest, or tied with [the state of] California, supports our assertion that these [incidents] are taking place in urban centers where the proximity in which people are living can contribute to these kinds of crimes being perpetuated,” says Taneika Taylor, director of communications at GenderPAC. ”And also something that I think that’s specific of D.C., is the visibility here of the community, in terms of LGBT and non-conforming people. Those two things playing together definitely contributed to D.C.’s ranking up there as one of the highest rated [for] incidents.”

50 Under 30 does not include any victims who were killed in Virginia or Maryland.

”It’s just an artifact of the data that there weren’t any victims in this report in Maryland and Virginia,” Taylor says, noting the age group studied.

”I don’t think they’re safer places, I think it’s just because we narrowed the scope of the report.”

The data cited in the report was compiled from a variety of sources including, Web sites, hate-crimes reports, news articles and online databases.

50 Under 30 reveals some startling facts:

”All assailants are male; most attack biologically-male peers their own age; most assailants use extreme violence; most assailants live in major cities; most murders aren’t investigated as Hate Crimes; [and] most assailants go free.”

It also concludes that most victims are of color (black and Latino), poor, transgender or gay, are biologically male but not presenting masculinity, and are ignored by media.

GenderPAC has been collecting data about transgender murders around the nation since the gropu formed 10 ten years ago. Last year, members of the organization decided to compile a report, about those murders, which would become 50 under 30.

”For too long, the lives and murders of these young people have gone under-solved and under-reported,” Taylor says. ”This violence, these murders, have been weighing heavily on our organizational heart for years. 50 Under 30 is our response to this and our effort to not only convey the tragic, personal toll behind these murders but to also bring greater awareness to this epidemic of violence.”

After taking a closer look at the victims, Taylor and other members of GenderPAC were able to conclude that all of the cases had many similarities.

”We noticed that most victims were people of color, most were under the age of 30, and most of them were killed in urban centers. We thought that was a significant interception of some very unique characteristics that were and are making these young people susceptible to the fatal violence.”

Taylor worked with about 15 other staff members, volunteers and correspondents to compile the data for 50 Under 30, which she co-wrote with Riki Wilchins, executive director of GenderPAC.

”50 Under 30 is an examination of a little more than 10 years of the casualties in this war being waged on youth aged 13-to-30,” Wilchins writes in the report’s opening letter.

”We focused on youth, both because there has been such indifference to the epidemic of gender-based violence against them and because youth are particularly vulnerable to such violence, often lacking adult advocates or sufficient financial and social capital to ensure their own safety.”

Taylor says she suspects that the number of people featured in the report would have ”almost doubled” if they had included victims over the age of 30 and under 13.

GenderPAC has distributed 50 Under 30 to more than 100 governmental and non-governmental human and civil rights agencies. There are plans to present a copy to the Organization of American States’s Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), a group that investigates human-rights abuses in North and South America, in February.

Taylor says GenderPAC is also working with various national partners in order to be able to reach various communities and people of different ethnicities, age groups and racial backgrounds.

”Raising awareness really is the first step that we can take in terms of transforming the culture that has allowed these murders to happen in a way that they’re under-solved [and] under-reported by most media outlets, outside the LGBT community,” she says.

”We hope that people will recognize the sorts of violence and aggression that American culture has become accepting of, in terms of enforcing masculinity or femininity.”

Mother blames small-minded attitudes for death of her transsexual daughter
Helen Carter

Mon 12 Jan 2004 02.48 GMT

They called her a freak, said she was "Tranny Paula", and would shout abuse at her in the street. Vicious words which her mother cannot bear to repeat.
Graffiti were daubed on the walls of her flat and the windows were smashed. She was beaten up and had two bald patches at the back of her head where her hair wouldn't grow back after she was attacked, once with an iron bar and once with a beer bottle.

The abuse began a decade earlier, when her mother kept having to wash her school blazer after other teenagers spat at her and called her names. She suffered concussion and had her nose broken.

Paula Greenall died four months ago under the wheels of a car, after she had endured many years of verbal and physical abuse from other young people. A coroner recorded an open verdict last week - her mother, Carole, had hoped it would be accidental death.

Paula became a target because, 24 years ago, she was born a boy. She lived in the small village of Wheelton, near Chorley, Lancashire: Carole, 47, blames people's small-minded attitudes for Paula's death.

Paul Greenall had realised he wanted to be a girl when he was 14 years old. "I always thought she was quite an unusual child," says Carole. "She was intelligent and hyperactive. She never stopped talking and was inquisitive."

Carole began to realise something was amiss when her child was at high school. "She grew her hair and she looked a lot more feminine. She would pull her jeans in to show off her waist. I wondered if she was gay, but we didn't really talk about it."

Carole realised Paul was being bullied on the school bus to Albany high school, three miles away. Paul had a 100% attendance record in her first year, but it began to tail off. At the age of 14, Paul was at a girlfriend's house when Carole received a telephone call from the girl's mother. "She said she was worried about Paul; he was very depressed and she was worried he would do something to himself as he said he wanted to be a girl.

"At the back of my mind, I knew, but I would not let myself consider the possibility: I was just in shock. I had watched a programme about transsexuals and had a feeling that a lot of things were like Paul."

Their GP referred Paul to a psychiatrist in Chorley. "After an hour with Paul he said he thought she was a transsexual and he referred us to a specialist in London who deals with gender problems."

Paula was taken out of school and had two years of home tuition. She dressed in unisex clothes and went to a psychiatrist in London every three months.

But she became frustrated as she had to wait two years for female hormones and was given a lower dose than she wanted. She was also having injections to suppress production of testosterone.

"It was humiliating when we were out and people were shouting abuse at her," says Carole. "If I was with her she would feel embarrassed for me and would try and hurry us on. I don't know how she put up with it for 10 years."

At 17 Paula moved to Brighton, where she had a boyfriend for two years. Her mother believes this was the happiest time of her life.

But during this time, she began taking heroin. Paula moved back to the village when she was 19, into a housing association flat in Clayton Brook. "As soon as she moved into the flat, people started to spray graffiti and her windows were broken. She was becoming more dependent on drugs. Her front windows were smashed and were left boarded up for three months before they were replaced.

"The police were worried, but nobody could help. She had to go on the bus into Chorley every day to pick up her methadone prescription and she would get beaten up and end up in casualty."

She is annoyed that Paula was ridiculed for a problem which was caused by a birth defect. "A psychiatrist explained to me that all foetuses start as female and then there are changes in the brain which make it male. Other people with children with birth defects get sympathy - but all we got was abuse."

She says Paula didn't just want to be a woman, she wanted to be a perfect woman. "She was very critical of herself and her hips were never quite shapely enough." When she was 22, Paula had breast implants - which she was delighted with - and she finally had a sex change operation in October 2002, 11 months before her death. "She was so pleased with the way she looked after the operation," says her mother. "It seems so terrible that she went through so much physical and mental pain in her life to meet such a terrible end."

On the day of her death Paula went to a pub with a friend and an argument developed after they had been drinking. They turned up at her mother's house, but she wouldn't let them in as they were in such a state.

"She was very upset and she ran off saying, 'I am going to kill myself.' But she had said that so many times before. Then I had the phone call from the hospital saying Paula's been hit by a car.

"One of my daughters said that some of the teenagers had said to her, 'We didn't mean what we said.' But she just said, 'It is too late.'"
