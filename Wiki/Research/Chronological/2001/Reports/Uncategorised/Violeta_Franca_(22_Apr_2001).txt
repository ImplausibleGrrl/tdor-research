Violet's death in Campo da Barca, a 20-year-old case
On today's Memory Channel, review the news from the DIARY of April 22, 2001

Exactly 20 years ago, DIÁRIO reported the case of the death of Violeta, a transgender person who died following a fall from the terrace of the Campo da Barca auto-silo. It fell from an approximate height of five meters. His body was lifted off the road by the Madeiran Volunteer Firefighters. The victim was polytraumatized, with serious injuries and a fractured skull.

At the time, two hypotheses were put forward to explain the cause of the incident: accidental fall or homicide. There were witnesses in the vicinity who said that he would have been the target of aggression. The body was taken to the morgue at the Cruz de Carvalho Hospital for autopsy.

Today, 20 years later, DIÁRIO sought to find out, from several entities, the conclusions of the investigation, but without success. However, it is known that there was no judgment related to the case. On the other hand, if there was a crime of homicide, it can no longer be investigated or prosecuted, as it expires after 15 years.

Violeta, 37, was registered under the name Rui Alberto Jesus França. But he presented himself socially as a transgender person. His life path was somewhat problematic. The report signed 20 years ago by journalist José Ribeiro advanced some aspects: the victim “lived in those surroundings, more precisely in a wooden shack in Travessa do Matadouro (...) he no longer has parents, he lived alone, but those who (.. .) they met up close and guarantee that some of their relatives and godparents live somewhere, in Penteada ”.
