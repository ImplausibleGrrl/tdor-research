===== Man, 19, is arrested in slaying =====
**By THOM AKEMAN**

A transsexual who police described as a prostitute was stabbed to death, in his Comfort Street home early yesterday, police said.

Arrested last night and charged with second degree murder is Peter Secore, 19, who, police said, lived with the victim for the past two weeks.

Gordon Lee Bohrman, 33, who lived as a woman under the name Leah Wilder and sometimes used the name Lee Gordon, was killed about 2:15 a.m., police said.

The nude body was found slumped against a sofa of the victim's brick house at 54 Comfort St., near South Avenue, about 1 p.m.

 Secore, originally from Webster, was held without bail, pending arraignment in City Court tomorrow.

The victim had been stabbed in the back three times with a kitchen knife that was found near the body, said Detective Capt. Anthony Fantigrossi, chief of city detectives.

Police assume the victim knew the killer because several protective Doberman pinschers were in the house at the time of the slaying, Fantiegrossi said.

Eleven dogs — 3 full-grown Dobermans, 6 Doberman puppies and 2 French poodles — had to be removed by a city dog warden before police could get close enough to the body to examine it.

There were no signs of struggle, forced entry or robbery, police said.

Bohrman was last known to be alive about 10:30 p.m. Friday, when two men entered the house to see about buying one of the Doberman pinschers, Capt. Anthony Leonardo said.

Police carried several diaries, address books and telephone lists out of the house and checked the names and phone numbers in them last night.

The victim was arrested twice this year and charged with prostitution by vice detectives, police records show.

One charge was dropped without prosecution, court records show. Bohrman was convicted of the second charge in September and discharged without penalty, according to court records.

 Other court records show that Bohrman was undergoing medical treatment to become a woman.

He was sentenced to five years proba-

===== SLAYING =====

tion in Monroe County Court Sept. 9 for selling marijuana to an undercover agent, after Judge Andrew G. Celli said Bohrman's sexual confusion may have caused him to turn to drugs.

"Maybe your sojourn into the drug scene might well have been caused by the trauma that you have suffered by reason of your transsexualism," Celli said at the sentencing.

He gave Borhman permission to leave Monroe County any time during his probation for any surgery necessary for a planned sex change.

 Bohrman, who was born a male, had wanted to be a woman all his life, his lawyer, Robert C. Napier, once said. Bohrman had suffered "tremendous psychological and social hurricanes" as a result of the sexual confusion, Napier said.

He is believed to have no living relatives, court records show.

His dogs will remain at the city dog pound until police determine what should be done with them, a dog warden said.
