===== Manslaughter =====

===== Secore found guilty of killing roommate =====

Peter G. Secore, 20, was convicted of first-degree manslaughter yesterday in the stabbing death of his transsexual roommate on Dec. 14, 1974.

A jury of 11 men and one woman returned the verdict at 6 p.m. after deliberating more than seven hours. Monroe County Court Judge Eugene W. Bergin set sentencing for Jan. 27.

Secore was charged with second-degree murder in the death of Gordon Boerman, 33, also known as Leah Wilder. The manslaughter conviction carries a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison and a minimum sentence of up to 8 1/3 years in prison.

During the three-day trial, Asst. Dist. Atty. James Boehler submitted a statement signed by Secore on Dec. 14 in which Secore admitted killing Boerman. Defense attorney Charles E. Steinberg tried to discredit the statement by saying it was taken after Secore was interviewed for four hours by members of the Rochester Police Department.

Secore originally told police he left his home at 54 Comfort St. at 8:30 a.m. Dec. 14 to go to work when he returned after lunch, he said he had to kick in the door because his key didn't work and found Boerman's body on the living room couch.

But in the signed statement to police, Secore said he stabbed Boerman several times after Boerman made sexual advances to him on the morning of Dec. 14. Boerman had undergone the first stages of a sex change operation.

A friend of Secore's, Robert S. Douglas, testified during the trial that he had gone to New York City with Secore four days before the murder. Secore bought a knife there and later said he was going to use it to kill Boerman, Douglas testified.
