===== 'I would be found out' =====

===== Murder trial testimony reversed =====

A key witness in the murder trial of Peter G. Secore reversed his testimony yesterday to say he heard Secore threaten to kill his roommate last December.

Robert S. Douglas, 20, told a Monroe County Court jury in the morning that he never heard Secore talk about killing Gordon Boerman, 33, also known as Leah Wilder.

After a lunch recess, however, Douglas said Secore threatened "to do away with Leah Wilder" during a conversation on Dec. 12, 1974. Asked why he changed his testimony, Douglas told the defense attorney that "I would be found out ... that I was lying."

Secore, 20, of 54 Comfort St., is charged with stabbing Boerman to death on Dec. 14, 1974. Boerman had undergone the first stages of a sex change operation. Secore called police on Dec. 14 and said he had discovered Boerman's body in the living room when he returned home from work about 1 p.m.

When Douglas began testifying yesterday and said he didn't remember much about the Dec. 12 conversation, prosecutor James Boehler asked for a recess to talk with Douglas. After a lunch recess, Douglas changed his testimony and recounted the conversation.

Douglas said he was mad at Leah Wilder because she had told police that he and his fiancee burglarized the Street of Shops in Webster on Dec. 8, 1974. Douglas said Secore was also involved in the burglary but that Leah Wilder hadn't told police about that.

The next Wednesday, Dec. 11, Secore, Douglas and Douglas' fiancee drove to New York City where Secore bought a knife, Douglas testified. The three returned to Rochester Dec. 12 and had a conversation "mainly about Leah Wilder" at Campi's Restaurant, he testifed.

"I put a suggestion in Peter's head" that he should kill Leah, Douglas said. Secore told him he agreed "and that that was the sole purpose of buying the knife. He was going to do away with Leah Wilder," Douglas testified.

Secore said he would make the murder look like a burglary by kicking down the front door of the Comfort Street house, Douglas said. A Rochester police technician testified Thursday that the front door of the house had been kicked in.

"At the time I just thought it was all steam . . I didn't believe Secore would kill her," Douglas said under cross-examination by defense attorney Charles E. Steinberg.

Douglas, who is currently serving a prison term at Albion Correctional Facility, was transported Tuesday to the Monroe County jail so he could testify during the trial. He testified that while in the county jail, he and Secore shouted to each other from their cells and that he was "all ready to stand up for him (Secore)" during the trial.

The trial will continue at 10 a m. Monday before Judge Eugene W. Bergin.
