On the morning of 14 December, 1974, transgender woman Leah Wilder, 33, was stabbed three times in her back and killed in her home at 54 Comfort St., Rochester, New York, by her roommate Peter Secore, 19.

Secore initially confessed to the killing, claiming that he had killed Leah after Leah made sexual advances to him that night. Secore was indicted on a charge of 2nd degree murder.

During the trial Secore attempted to retract the confession, while his friend, Robert S. Douglas, 20, said that the murder had been planned three days in advance, with the knife having been purchased specifically for the killing. Douglas said that the killing was in revenge for Leah having turned Douglas and his fiancee into the police for a burglary on 8 Dec. that Secore had also been involved in.

Secore was convicted of first degree manslaughter at trial in Dec., 1975. Conviction carried a minimum sentence of 8-1/3 years to a maximum of 25 years.
