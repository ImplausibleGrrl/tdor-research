> My friend Jake took his own life in December 2017. He was a young trans man and my best friend. When I got the opportunity to write the toolkit, I decided to pour everything I’ve got into it. I don’t know if anything that’s in it would have saved Jake’s life, but maybe it could save other trans peoples’ lives who are suffering.
