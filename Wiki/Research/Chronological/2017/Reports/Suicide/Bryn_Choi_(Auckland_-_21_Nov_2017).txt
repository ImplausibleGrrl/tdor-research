> A young transgender woman disclosed her suicide plan to a community care worker days before her death, a coroner has found.
> 
> A coroner’s report into the death of 19-year-old Sung-Ig Choi (known as Bryn Choi), found she had no access to transgender health services before her death and there was no evidence of a safety plan being put in place after she disclosed feeling suicidal.
> 
> Choi came under the care of Waitemata District Health Board (WDHB) mental health services in 2017 and Coroner Tania Tetitaha said there were no specifically targeted transgender health services available for her through the DHB.
> 
> Less than a week before Choi’s death she told a careworker of her suicide plan. Tetitaha said there was no evidence a safety plan was introduced after this.
> 
> After Choi’s death, WDHB completed an incident report which set out actions it would undertake including regular meetings between youth and adult services and risk-assessment and safety planning workshops.
> 
> Tetitaha said Choi’s death could’ve been prevented if an appropriate risk assessment had been done after she spoke about her suicidal intent.
> 
> Director specialist mental health and addictions services WDHB Dr Murray Patton told Tetitaha all the actions the review identified were completed.
> 
> Tetitaha said Choi’s death was the second she’d received which involved the suicide of a person transitioning from male to female.
> 
> “The commonalities between the deaths appear to be a lack of support and access to gender-affirming healthcare.
> 
> “Ms Choi was identified by her medical practitioner as struggling with identity. No clear path was taken that addressed those needs.”
> 
> There were guidelines for gender-affirming healthcare in Aotearoa, Tetitaha said, which recommended training and support services for people who were gender diverse or transgender.
> 
> The recommendations included that DHBs provide compulsory training for staff on supporting trans and gender diverse patients, as well as make access to information and peer support services easy.
> 
> It stated DHBs should have clear and timely referral pathways for young people and their whanau to access information about gender-affirming care.
> 
> Tetitaha said by 2020, it was understood the northern region DHBs had gender-affirming healthcare policies.
> 
> The policy included funding peer support roles for transgender people and their whanau through RainbowYouth and Outline, and a transgender health key worker employed by the DHB specifically to help people navigate services.
> 
> “Patients such as Ms Choi require access to gender-affirming healthcare resources, it’s been found to lower depression and suicidality among transgender and non-binary youth,” Tetitaha said.
> 
> Tetitaha recommended WDHB reassessed its gender-affirming healthcare policy and resources including staff training regarding support.
> 
> A spokesperson for WDHB said gender-affirming care was an important priority and they’d made “significant” improvements by offering gender-diversity training to staff.
> 
> “We offer gender-affirming healthcare within our child youth family mental health services. All clinicians are trained in assessment and intervention with all clients, including those who identify as gender-diverse.
> 
> “Referrals may be made to services for more-intensive support for youth who require specific support with gender concerns, including information, resources and advocacy.”
> 
> Claire Black, General Manager of OutLine Aotearoa said Choi’s death “deeply saddened” the organisation, as did the lack of support she received while seeking gender-affirming healthcare.
> 
> ”Trans, non-binary and takatapui people are sadly overrepresented in Aotearoa’s suicide statistics and a lack of access to gender-affirming healthcare can compound pressures for trans people who are already vulnerable to greater unemployment, housing insecurity, and discrimination.
> 
> “Good access to gender-affirming healthcare improves lives and reduces the risks of depression and suicide.”
> 
> Black said there was still work to be done but availability of health support services for trans, non-binary and takatapui people had improved significantly since 2017.
> 
> Outline and RainbowYouth had been contracted by Auckland’s DHBs since 2019 to provide a trans peer support service.
> 
> Black said this consisted of one-on-one peer support and counselling, as well as group peer support.

> CIRCUMSTANCES
> 
> Sung-Ig Choi (also known as Bryn Choi), aged 19 years, died on 21 November 2017 at Auckland in circumstances amounting to suicide.
> 
> In 2015 Sung-Ig began the process of transitioning from male to female using hormone therapy.
> 
> In 2017 Sung-Ig came under the care of Waitemata District Health Board (WDHB) mental health services. No specifically targeted transgender health services were available through the WDHB. On 15 November 2017, Sung-Ig disclosed her suicide plan to a community care worker. There was no evidence of a safety plan being introduced.
> 
> Following Sung-Ig’s death, WDHB completed a significant incident review report, which made the following key recommendations:
> 
> a) Where a number of agencies are involved a lead provider must be identified. The lead provider must take responsibility for coordinating liaison between providers and the sharing of information about treatment and treatment plans.
> b) Allocation of care coordinators should take into account the complexity of the presentation and aim for uninterrupted relationships where there [are] identified issues for an individual, wherever possible.
> 
> c) As per the risk assessment and safety planning policy, republished April 2018, page 2, risk formulation has a foundation of collaboration. More experienced clinicians should be accessible for less experienced clinicians to consult with at all times.
> 
> 
> COMMENTS OF CORONER TETITAHA
> 
> There were key recommendations identified by the WDHB as part of the circumstances leading to Sung-Ig’s death. All of the key recommendations could have prevented her death including in particular undertaking an appropriate risk assessment following her disclosure of suicidal intent as per the District Health Board’s policies.
> The WDHB significant incident review report set out a number of actions for the purposes of addressing the above key recommendations. These included:
> a) regular liaison meetings between youth services, adult mental health services and Youth Hub.
> b) audits recovery team caseload to ensure complex case reviews are scheduled as required by the complex case and team review guidelines.
> 
> c) report writer to meet with team manager and clinical coordinators to reinforce prioritisation of therapeutic relationships.
> 
> d) team-based risk assessment and safety planning workshop to be completed
> 
> I sought comment from the WDHB regarding the implementation of the key recommendations as the information on file indicated only one of the recommendations had been actioned. I had intended recommending they complete the recommendations and/or a referral to the Health and Disability Commissioner to monitor completion.
> A report has now been received from Dr Patton, Director specialist mental health and addictions services WDHB attaching a revised and updated adverse event report. It notes all of the actions have now been completed, albeit action for (team-based risk assessment and safety planning workshop) was repeatedly deferred due to COVID-19 restrictions through 2021. These have now been completed.
> The report also notes since this death, the complex case review policy has been recently revised and consultation on a draft revised document undertaken. A copy of the final policy was attached to the report.
> I thank the WDHB for their replies and additional information.
> RECOMMENDATIONS OF CORONER TETITAHA
> 
> This is the second death I have received involving suicide by a person transitioning from male to female.[1] The commonalities between the deaths appear to be a lack of support and/or access to gender-affirming healthcare.
> Ms Choi was identified by her medical practitioner as struggling with her identity. No clear referral pathway was identified that addressed her specific needs.
> There are guidelines for gender affirming healthcare for gender diverse and transgender children, young people and adults in New Zealand[2] (the guidelines). The guidelines recommend amongst other things training and support services for gender diverse and transgender persons. Those recommendations include that DHB’s:
> a) provide compulsory training for staff on supporting trans and gender diverse patients;
> b) easily accessible information and access to peer support services for trans people of all ages and their whanau;
> 
> c) have clear and timely referral pathways for young people and their whanau to access information about gender affirming care.
> 
> In 2020 it was understood the northern region DHBs (including WDHB) had a gender affirming healthcare policy. This policy included funding peer support roles for transgender people and their whanau through RainbowYOUTH and OUTline and a transgender health key worker employed by the Auckland DHB specifically to help people navigate access to gender-affirming health services.[3] The information from the WDHB did not address whether these gender-affirming healthcare resources were at the time and remain available for patients such as Ms Choi.
> The WDHB workshops completed dealt with training in risk assessment but did not reference any training in gender affirming healthcare. This may need further review.
> Patients such as Ms Choi require access to gender affirming healthcare resources. Access to gender affirming healthcare has been found to be lower depression and suicidality among transgender and non-binary youth.[4]
> Having considered the information received I am making a recommendation that the Waitemata District Health Board draft and/or re-assess its gender affirming healthcare policy and resources including staff training regarding supporting gender diverse and transgender patients.
> Note: An order under s 71 of the Coroners Act applies. No person may make public the method of death, or any detail that suggests the method of death.
> 
> Note: An order under section 74 of the Coroners Act 2006 prohibits the publication of photographs taken of Sung-Ig Choi, also known as Bryn Choi, during this inquiry in the interests of decency.
