"Trans" child commits suicide a year after changing gender

After being renamed Jay, after being baptized as Jane Marie, this 13-year-old ' trans ' child decided to commit suicide. A year of gender change had passed and, now, the parents came out to express that their son's decision, a year ago, was not a solution.

Born as a girl Jay chose to change gender and be one of the so-called ' trans ' children . After taking his own life, the family made a ' mea ' blame on whether the support for the decision to change gender was positive or generated more stress and ended up taking the adolescent ' trans ' to this drastic decision.

" We were under the care of a psychologist from the first day, " said Erin, Jay's father. The ' trans ' child started his group therapy at the same time he started the treatment with the ingestion of the medication for sex change. To the internal struggles of the adolescent ' trans ' was added the weight that meant, at his young age, to be an activist of the LGBT community.

While the parents begin to question the social acceptance that their daughter had and the pressure of the LGBT lobby to be a ' trans ' child ; Several studies show as a tendency that, at least 41% of American transsexuals have had a suicide attempt. The American College of Pediatricians resumed the issue before this case and noted that children seeking sex change should be treated for gender dysphoria.
