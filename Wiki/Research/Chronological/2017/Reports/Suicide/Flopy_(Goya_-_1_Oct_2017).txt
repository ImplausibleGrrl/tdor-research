suicide

Flopy, a transvestite, daughter of a man arrested and prosecuted for drug trafficking in Goya, was found this Sunday, hanged at her home, in a fact that once again splashes the political power of the province of Corrientes, and in which neighbors and friends they questioned the suicide hypothesis that the provincial Justice hastened to report.

The deceased, known as “ Flopy”, was the daughter of Néstor Fabián “Chupín” Rodríguez, a 55-year-old man who is detained and processed in Santa Fe with three other Goyans; all accused in a drug trafficking case  since the Santa Fe police raided and kidnapped marijuana in Goya on December 21, 2016.

That day, Governor Ricardo Colombi was accused of hindering the Federal Justice operation by showing up at the raided site and ordering the head of the local police station to detain the chief of Dangerous Drugs of Santa Fe, José Moyano, who commanded the operation.

Flopy was a well-known hairdresser in the city and her friends assure that she had no intention of killing herself because she had not manifested signs of any nature in this regard. During the early hours of Sunday, Flopy danced without showing signs of depression,  in a Goyan bowling alley with her friends, and two hours later, they found her dead at home.    

For the death of the young woman there is no detainee and the Provincial Police limited itself to informing that it was a suicide, and also quickly spread a morbid photo where she appears hanged , without even covering her features and with the clear intention of making believe that she had killed herself. The Investigating Court maintains a curious secrecy about the cause, although it hastened to label the case as "supposed suicide" and thus let it transcend.

Flopy's father is noted as "Goya's most important drug trafficker",  but he also ran studs, where race horses are cared for, he owned some horses, in the same Goyano racecourse where Ricardo Colombi was a month ago the day he a mare died in overdose in the middle of a race.  The mare, who died instantly while running, was owned by the footballer José “Pepe” Sand.
