> Just this week, the Dallas Police Department posted on its blog, DPDBeat.com, asking for help in solving the 2017 murder of transgender woman Armani Dante Morgan.
>
> Morgan’s family reported her missing on June 22, 2017; one month and two days later, her body was found near the 2900 block of Wilhurt Ave., an area west of I-45 and just south of Illinois Avenue that, police said, she was known to frequent.

> 
> DALLAS—A string of deadly attacks on black transgender women here—with two killed since April—has captured national attention and left the trans community on edge.
> 
> Now The Daily Beast has learned that authorities are also investigating the 2017 death of a black transgender woman named Armani Dante Morgan. Police have not said Morgan’s death is related to the other cases—but her family is demanding equal treatment from investigators.
> 
> “I want the Dallas Police Department to actually start pursuing Armani’s death like they are the other cases,” Robin Johnson, Morgan’s aunt, told The Daily Beast. “I get it, [her] case is gonna be a tough case to solve because it was only skeletal remains that were found… but they have been trying to give up on this case since day one.”
> 
> Morgan’s remains were found in a field on the city’s east side in July 2017. Police initially told the family they suspected the 27-year-old died of an overdose, according to Johnson. Now, police have said her death is an “open investigation.” The medical examiner’s report said the cause of death was “undetermined” due in large part to the fact that only Morgan’s skeletal remains were recovered.
> 
> “We have not ruled out criminal conduct, however there is insufficient information thus far to indicate that her death was the result of a criminal act,” a police spokesperson told The Daily Beast.
> 
> Johnson said the family immediately suspected she was killed, because she was attacked four times—including once by gunfire—in the days preceding her death.
> 
> On May 31, 2017, someone shot into Morgan’s apartment where she lived with her mother, according to Johnson. When Morgan and her mother went outside after the bullet pierced a window, Morgan was attacked by a close female associate and her teenage daughter, Johnson said.
> 
> Video reviewed by The Daily Beast shows a woman punch Morgan in the face in the parking lot and Morgan falling to the ground. Another woman then approaches Morgan with her fists raised and pushes her before the video ends.
> 
> It was the second in a series of attacks on Morgan carried out by the woman, Johnson said. The third and final attack came on June 3, 2017, and occurred not far from Morgan’s home. That was the last day she was seen alive.
> 
> Johnson said the woman had accused Morgan of stealing money from her and police interviewed her.
> 
> After Morgan went missing, family and friends looked for her unsuccessfully. Almost two months later, a passerby found Morgan’s skull near a field less than a mile from her home.
> 
> Morgan’s family contacted the medical examiner to see if any bodies had shown up and learned of the skeletal remains found not far from where Morgan was last seen. Morgan’s mother submitted for a DNA test that provided authorities with a positive match.
> 
> The rest of her skeleton was recovered by police in a nearby field, according to the medical examiner’s report, along with a bag containing clothes and toiletries.
> 
> “It feels as if our community is being attacked.”
> — Krista De La Rosa
> “All of the…[recent] transgender deaths and assaults have gotten the media attention that those cases deserve but unfortunately, Armani’s did not receive any media attention at all at the time Armani’s badly decomposed remains were unexpectedly discovered,” Johnson told The Daily Beast.
> 
> After Morgan died, four other women were attacked in cases that remain unsolved, and three of them died. Police said there are “similarities” between three of the attacks: All were black trans women who were in vehicles with someone else before they were attacked.
> 
> Transgender activists and advocates held a private meeting Wednesday night and a public one on Thursday to discuss how to help trans women, especially those of color, and make them aware of resources and allies that support them. A march was held Sunday demanding justice for the trans community, which has seen at least nine black trans women murdered across the country so far this year.
> 
> “We’re hurting, we’re angry, we’re pissed, and we’re in various emotional stages of grievance,” Carmarion Anderson, a trans activist, said at Thursday’s meeting.
> 
> Krista De La Rosa, a trans woman and activist, has been in regular contact with police regarding the disturbing string of deaths.
> 
> “Right now everyone’s just really[...] it’s a bunch of mixed emotions—some are angry, some are still mourning, some don’t know how to feel,” De La Rosa told The Daily Beast. “It feels as if our community is being attacked.”
> 
> In October 2018, police said, Brittany White was found shot to death inside a car where she had been with someone else. In April 2019, a transgender woman who had also been in a car with someone was stabbed multiple times and survived. She gave police a description of her attacker: a black male in a silver or gray car.
> 
> Police said at a May 21 press conference there is a “nexus” between the attacks and the intersection of Spring and Lagow. Local residents told The Daily Beast that Spring and Lagow is where people seek out transgender and gay sex workers.
> 
> “We don’t know if we’re looking for a john or not, we’re just looking for a suspect,” a police spokesperson told The Daily Beast last week, adding the department would not comment on “possible lifestyles beyond that they were transgender.”



This is Armani Dante Morgan, a resident of Dallas Texas. 
Since 2017, at least five trans women of color have been murdered in Dallas, Texas. We will be doing profiles on the five we are aware of: Muhlaysia Booker, Shade Schuler, Chynal Lindsey, Brittany White, and Armani Dante Morgan. 

**Who was Armani?**

Since Muhlaysia Booker’s murder in 2019, Armani’s name has been brought up as an example of the growing number of trans women who have been murdered in Dallas, and many speculate whether she was murdered by Muhlaysia’s killer, Kendrell Levar Lyles. The same details are always provided:

● Armani went missing in 2017

● Armani’s body was found skeletonized in a field not very far from where she lived

● The police think Armani could have been murdered by Lyles

What the media has yet to report is what her job was, her relationship with her family was, anything about the friends and community that miss her, and any of the little tidbits that make up a person. Who was she outside of this one act of violence? In an interview with The Daily Beast, Armani’s aunt said: 

“All of the…[recent] transgender deaths and assaults have gotten the media attention that those cases deserve but unfortunately, Armani’s did not receive any media attention at all at the time Armani’s badly decomposed remains were unexpectedly discovered.”

This appears to be largely true. We could not find any news articles from 2017 reporting on Armani’s disappearance and murder, other than a page from the Charley Project . Beyond this Daily Beast article, we could find no other information about Armani. 

We tried looking for an obituary or a funeral announcement, news articles, press releases, anything, and came up empty. We did find an old social media profile for Armani, but the only two items posted were profile pictures from 2014. Through that media page we did find one person who knew her, but unfortunately the last post made on the friend’s account was made in July 2017, right after they heard the news about Armani’s death. Since then there has been no activity on that profile. So, as it stands, we know next to nothing about who Armani was.

But we do know that she was a person, and because of that she is deserving of our attention and concern about how her murder is resolved. We should scrutinize why the media now deems her murder worth reporting, while reporting nothing of substance about her. 

**Armani's Timeline**

While not much is known about Armani-the-person, thanks to the Daily Beast, we do have an idea of the interactions she had before she disappeared and after she was found. 

5/31/2017 – an “acquaintance” (a woman who is not Lyles) and her daughter shot into Armani’s apartment, which she shared with her mom. When Armani ran outside to see who was shooting, the “acquaintance” and the daughter attacked Armani and filmed the assault.   
6/3/2017 – the same “acquaintance” attacks Armani again. Armani’s aunt said the “acquaintance” accused Armani of stealing money. 
6/3/2017 – later that night, Armani goes missing. 
6/22/2017 – Armani’s family reports her missing
7/23/2017 – Armani’s skull (and later the rest of her skeletonized remains) is found in a field by her home. 
7/?/2017 – Armani’s family hears about the remains found near their home and ask for DNA analysis to see if the body is Armani. The medical examiner does so and confirms Armani’s identity. 
?/?/2017 – Medical examiners say they cannot determine the cause of death but think it is likely a drug overdose.
6/?/2019 – in light of the murder of Muhlaysia Booker (and the subsequent media attention of the murders of Shade Schuler, Chynal Lindsey, and Brittany White) the police decide to investigate her death further. 

**Who is the Acquaintance?**

Obviously the first thing that jumps out in that timeline is the unnamed acquaintance. We couldn’t dig up any information on who she is, but it is surprising that after 4 attacks by this person (the Daily Beast article, that we pull a great deal of our information from, only details 3 attacks, but states there are 4 in total) the police lean toward Armani’s death being a result of a drug overdose. The Daily Beast says the police interviewed the acquaintance, but there is nothing after that. Did she have an airtight alibi for AFTER she attacked Armani the same night she died? We know it’s not impossible that Armani was attacked by two completely separate individuals in one day (as you will see with Muhlaysia Booker’s case), one leading to death.  We also know that there is the possibility that Police do think she is a suspect but they do not have enough evidence to charge her. But why suggest a drug overdose as the cause of death? 

**Drug Overdoses and Skeletonized Remains**

So, obviously we are not forensic pathologists, medical examiners, or anything remotely close. Take all of our scientific interpretations with a huge grain of salt. 
We were curious about how long it takes for a body to skeletonize, and whether you can determine drug OD from skeletonized remains. First, your body can skeletonize surprisingly quickly it seems! A body can turn into a skeleton within three weeks. This, of course, is entirely dependent on external environmental factors, like weather, humidity, etc. Armani’s body becoming skeletonized between 6/3 and 7/22 does seem in the realm of possibility. 

As for a drug overdose, we wish we knew more about Armani. Did Armani take drugs (no judgement if so)? Medical examiners, beyond physical data obtained from a body, can also use family and personal history to help determine cause of death. Did the medical examiner in this case lean towards a drug overdose before or after Armani’s family was notified? What we’re getting at is whether there were significant amounts of drugs in her system to indicate a likely drug overdose, or whether the medical examiner heard from Armani’s family that she did drugs and those compounds were found in her skeletal remains, or whether it was a mix of the two scenarios. 

Another question begs to be asked: how reliable are post-mortem toxicology tests done on skeletonized remains? We had a hard time finding an answer to that specific question, but we did find out that blood tests are the only way to certify a drug overdose . So again, we wonder what factors indicated to the medical examiner that Armani died of a drug overdose. 
We can speculate, however, that it is likely that there were no obvious gunshot wounds on the available remains (also, was her entire skeleton present?), otherwise that would have been a clearer sign of foul play. 

**Kendrell Levar Lyles**

Now that Muhlaysia Booker’s killer, Lyles, has been apprehended, people have begun to wonder if he is responsible for any other murders of trans women in the Dallas area. If you look up the case, you will see repeated over and over again that he is also being charged with the murders of two unnamed individuals and speculation that he could be responsible for the murders of Shade Schuler, Chynal Lindsey (after initial news articles suggesting a possible link to Lyles, a different person has become the prime suspect and is being charged with her murder), Brittany White, and Armani. 
We  were able to find the names of his alleged other victims and they are Leticia Grant (as far as we currently know a cis-gendered woman of color), and Kenneth Cichocki (as far as we currently know a cis-gendered white man). We only feel comfortable reporting these names as they have been reported in other news articles. 

**The general timeline we have for Lyle's activities is:**

5/18/2019 – Muhlaysia Booker is seen getting into a car matching Lyles’s and is later found critically wounded by a gunshot. Police later figure out that he kept her phone with him in his car after the murder. 
5/23/2019 – Lyles shot and killed Kenneth Cichocki. It was later discovered that Kenneth and Lyles were communicating via Facebook right up until he was shot. It is unclear whether this was done via the Facebook Messenger app on their phones, but if Kenneth was messaging Lyles from the parking lot he was murdered in, it would make sense that it was via cell phone. 
5/22/2019 – tip comes into the police about Lyles from a witness
5/24/2019 – Lyles shot and killed Leticia Grant. After 2 unnamed witnesses came forward, police learned that Lyles and Leticia had been in contact via telephone before her murder. 
6/5/2019 – Lyles is arrested

A couple of things stand out initially:

● All three victims were shot
● All three victims were killed in a timespan of 7 days
● All three victims had some kind of phone (or in Kenneth’s case, Facebook) interaction with Lyles shortly before their murders
● This is not shown in the timeline above, but we were able to find out Lyles’ address and from that determined that all three murders occurred within 15 to 30 minutes driving distance of Lyles’ home. 
Can these factors help us (or really, investigators) judge the likelihood that Lyles murdered Armani? Let’s break it down into another bullet-point list by factor:
● **Literal timeline:** Armani was murdered in 2017, while his other three victims were all killed within 7 days. (One thing that is interesting to note, is that the 3 victims he is being charged for all occurred in mid to late May. Armani was murdered in early June.) For this to mean anything to us (and investigators) we would need to be able to tell if Lyles is a serial killer or a spree killer. The main difference between the two seems to boil down to motive and timespan. As of right now, we do not know enough about Lyles to determine whether his motives/life align with someone who would kill in 2017 and then kill again in 2019 (and truly, we have no way of knowing if there are other victims). One thing that would suggest that perhaps Lyles is not a serial killer, but rather an unfocused spree killer, is that he confessed to different witnesses about at least one of the murders, and in Kenneth’s case, had another person in the car when he “went out to use the bathroom” and shot Kenneth (the witness was able to hear the gunshots from Lyles’ car). Would someone so careless about his murders in 2019 have been able to keep quiet about a murder in 2017? But, if he was responsible for Armani’s death, maybe he did confess it to someone but that witness never came forward. 
● **Murder weapon:** Lyles used a gun in the three murders he is being charged for. As we saw earlier, the medical examiner in Armani’s case thought the cause of death to be a drug overdose. This implies that there were no obvious signs of a gunshot. We know Leticia was shot in the head, but we do not know where Muhlaysia and Kenneth were shot (and both survived long enough to be transported to a hospital, which implies it may not have been as lethal a shot as one to the head). But, maybe Armani was shot in a way that the wound caused her death but went through the body without hitting any bones. Assuming the investigators on the scene who recovered Armani’s body were thorough, we can suspect that there was no physical evidence of a gunshot onsite (shell casings, broken up bits of a bullet, etc). This is not concrete evidence either way, but something to consider. 
● **Phone**: Did investigators recover Armani’s phone? Was there any evidence of contact between Lyles and Armani before her death? Did Armani reach out to the Facebook account that Kenneth was in contact with? This seems to be the most concrete way investigators have linked Lyles to his victims. 
● **Distance from his home:** Armani’s home is within 18-22 minutes driving time from Lyles’ home. HOWEVER. Using Google Maps, we determined that from the top to the bottom of Dallas takes about 30 minutes driving time, and from West to East is also about 30 minutes driving time. So, in reality, the physical distance from Lyles’ home may be meaningless. All this really tells us is that Lyles stayed in his same city when committing murder, not that Armani’s location had any special connection to Lyles. 

**The media**

We have to say, none of this is especially compelling evidence. Our suspicion is that the media leapt upon the idea that Lyles is a serial killer targeting trans women in the Dallas area. They speculated that he was connected to Chynal Lindsay’s death, when later someone completely unrelated was charged with her murder. Look at the headline in the second image. 

It seems relatively innocuous for the media to speculate about a serial killer, especially if that information comes from the police – these types of crimes are wildly popular in our culture, and popularity sells papers/subscriptions/gets attention. Why wouldn’t the media leap on this? Why are we riled up about it? Consider: if the public views a serial killer responsible for the deaths of trans women in Dallas, will they think that means there isn’t an epidemic of violence occurring against tans and gender-non-conforming individuals in this area, but instead just one crazy guy. If the public believes these crimes are the work of one serial killer, why have any policies protecting this group of people? If people are led to believe that these murders are not a systemic issue (they are) then they may be less willing to listen when activists say we need legal protections for this group. 

Remember, police have now charged someone completely different with Chynal’s murder. Further, we initially came across Armani’s story because the BBC  reported that “an unidentified trans woman in 2017…was found in the same lake as Chynal” in the course of their report on her murder. We wanted to know more about this “unidentified trans woman” and scoured news articles about bodies that were found in White Rock Lake in 2017. We found an article  that said in November 2017 an unidentified body was found in in the lake, but as far as we were able to determine, there was no follow up on who that body was, so we cannot say if the person was trans. Realistically, there are 2 scenarios:

1. The BBC conflated Armani and the unidentified person in White Rock Lake. (We looked up the place Armani’s remains were found relative to White Rock Lake, and there is a 26 minute driving distance between the two, so it seems unlikely that someone confused the field as part of the park surrounding the lake.)

2. The BBC did not conflate Armani with someone else, and there really is another trans victim in Dallas from 2017. In this case, who is this victim and why aren’t we hearing about them?

This matters because scenarios one and two both lead to the same place: that trans women are being killed and left in a specific geographic location, giving implied evidence to the serial killer theory.

And beyond that, our justice system isn’t tracking data about trans women who have been murdered! As we’ve covered before, agencies like the Human Rights Campaign, that are doing the crucial data tracking on violent attacks and murders on trans and LGBTQ folks, are often forced to partially rely on media coverage to help them capture these victims in their data sets. When the media messes up, it could compromise data collection, which in turn can impact state level policy. 
As time passes and we learn the reality of who is responsible for each of these murders, the damage will already be done. How often do you follow each new development of a murder case, even if its local? How often do you find out your initial assumptions (fed by the media) were wrong? We know we would be susceptible to seeing a headline of “serial killer in Dallas targeting trans women” and having that stick. 

Media matters because we don’t all have the bandwidth to interrogate every bit of news we consume. We can’t all spend hours researching and digging up court documents and cross referencing. Trans women, and especially trans women of color, ARE being targeted, this is undeniable, the evidence is there. But not by the same people. They are being targeted by a variety of individuals who are raised in a society that says hurting trans people (or LGBTQ people in general, or people of color in general) is ok. It is insidious. 

Also ask yourself why the police would want to suggest there is a serial killer responsible for cold cases of murdered trans women. Is it because they believe it likely? Or, is it because they want to close those cases? Does it look different in FBI data collection to say a serial killer is targeting trans people rather than many cases perpetrated by different people? Could that mask true gender-based hate crimes (and remember, Texas has no laws protecting people on the basis of gender identity)? We do not know the answers to these questions.  

We ask you, reader, to think about what information is missing when you read the news. Not all news is wrong, and we don’t want you to leave thinking the point of this article is “fake news!” We should always interrogate and critically think about what information is presented to us. When it comes to these specific issues, the media has historically done a disservice to the LGBTQ community. 

This is not the last you will hear from us on Kendrell Lyles or Dallas. 

**Final Thoughts**

Ultimately, we are happy the police are reopening Armani’s case for investigation, as well as other cold cases like Shade Schuler’s murder. Even if it is in the pursuit of a serial killer, hopefully it will lead to real closure and real difference. All of these women deserve justice and we deeply hope that this justice will come. We also hope that there will come a day when trans women of color are not targeted for violence and can live in peace. Please consider donating to local or national organizations that help bring visibility to these issues! 

We hope that you will begin to question and critically analyze the media you consume.
