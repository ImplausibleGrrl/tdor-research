SAN FRANCISCO (KGO) -- Everywhere you turn in San Francisco's Tenderloin neighborhood, there are reminders of Anthony "Bubbles" Torres and his killing from last September.

Pictures and posters of his likeness are posted on many light poles. Countless people sharing their memories of the transgender activist and DJ. 

"Every time you passed him it was like walking through a rainbow. He was magical." smiles Liza Muawski, a Tenderloin resident. 

A little over 5 months since his murder at Larkin and Myrtle, across from the New Century strip club, San Francisco Police released an arrest warrant for 30-year old Hieu Trung Nguyen, a resident of the city. 

The news provides little comfort to those who knew him best. 

"So upsetting. It's just so upsetting. It was a terrible thing, he was, the guy was amazing." sniffles David Lewis, who admits he's slightly relieved, but still shaken.

To this community, a positive ID on Nguyen and a 15-million dollar bail is a start. But there is much work to be done. 

"Yes, I'd be happier if they can arrest that suspect," cried one woman who says she would like to see no bail set at all and for Nguyen to go straight to prison. 

Jim Reilly, the attorney for Bubbles' family says he believes police knew of the suspect long before today's announcement and is hoping for a swift resolution. 

"We're calling for law enforcement statewide to bring this guy to justice." 

For many Tenderloin regulars, Bubbles — with their platinum hair, bright lipstick and mutton chops — was a sweet reminder of the eccentricity of the neighborhood. The persona “Bubbles,” created by Anthony Torres several years ago, was a frequent late-night presence on the streets of San Francisco. As Marke Bieschke put it on 48 Hills, “You couldn’t help but smile when Bubbles rushed toward you at the club or on the sidewalk, like a hyperactive, hairy grandma ready to smother you with panicked attention.”

Saturday morning, Bubbles was killed on the corner of Larkin and Myrtle streets, outside the New Century Strip Club. Local activist David Elliott Lewis heard the gun shots, and was one of the first — through interviews with victims and a call to the Medical Examiner’s Office — to identify the victim as Bubbles. “According to witlessness she was yelled at and chased by an male Asian patron from the Century strip club across the street on Larkin,” he wrote on Facebook. “After Bubbles fell to the ground, the assailant fired at least five rounds point blank. By the time an ambulance had arrived, it was too late.”

Their death left many who knew them in shock. On Sunday evening, around 150 people gathered at the intersection where Bubbles was killed to share stories and pay their respects.
