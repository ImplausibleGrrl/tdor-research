Sanath Kumara was a Sri Lankan activist committed to raising transgender awareness of HIV prevention. The lives of trans and trans are not easy in countries like Sri Lanka, so much so that it was discovered that Sanath herself was a transgender woman only after her death. On September 5, 2017, at the age of 34 she was found dead in the parking lot of a hospital in Dumballa: she was brutally hit with wooden bats.

Sanath's sister learned of this with a phone call from the same murderer, who swore at her without revealing her identity.
