> The Justice of Ceará pronounced the man accused of beating and stabbing the transvestite Beyoncé (social name) in Fortaleza to a popular jury. JosimBerg Rodrigues de Abreu will be tried for triple murder. The crime took place in February 2017, in the Messejana neighborhood. According to the complaint, the murder was homophobic in motive.
> 
> According to the indictment, Josimberg acted cruelly by subjecting the victim to intense physical and mental suffering. The transvestite was killed by blows with a knife with a closed abdominal trauma. She was rescued by witnesses, but she couldn't resist. The accused alleges to have acted in self-defence, a thesis rejected by the 1st Jury of the Comarca of Fortaleza.
> 
> The judicial order points out that the man would have acted "impregnated with undue social prejudices and by a reprehensible and repugnant homophobic feeling". the need to employ violent means used in crime under the argument of self-defense.
> 
> The court's decision is based on a complaint by the Public Ministry of Ceará (MPCE) filed in the same year as the crime. The accusatory piece maintains that Josimberg committed the murder using clumsiness, cruelty and a resource that made it impossible for the victim to defend himself. The violent practices mentioned by the MPCE were the same used by the Justice to classify homicide as triple qualified. The trial date has yet to be set.
