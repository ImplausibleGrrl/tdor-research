The body of the transvestite murdered at dawn on Friday in the Santa Branca neighborhood, Pampulha Region, in Belo Horizonte, was buried on Saturday afternoon (3/6) in Montes Claros. The name of baptism of the victim, of 26 years, is Rômulo Araújo Lopes.

Lopes was shot dead in the leg. According to the Military Police (PM), a witness said that he was crossing the streets of Monte Castelo and Antero de Quental when he saw a silver car parked. Soon after, she heard the sound of a gunshot coming from the vehicle.

The transvestite disembarked from the passenger's door, bloody, and ran off to Teles de Menezes Street. According to police, the witness said he ran in the same direction and heard more shots. The car left the scene and the victim fell unconscious.

When the MP arrived at the scene, a team from the Mobile Emergency Service (Samu) was already there and confirmed the death of the transvestite, wounded in the left leg. As a transvestite, Romulus adopted the codename "Dona Roma."

According to a friend of Romulus, he was a militant of the movements for the defense of the rights of homosexuals and minorities and even participated in a non-governmental organization (NGO) linked to the cause. Still according to the same source, Romulus knew the author of the shot that killed him. The crime would have been motivated by a disagreement between them.
