> In the '90s she was in the public spotlight, when the Justice wanted to take custody of three children from her, but she managed to adopt them.
> 
> "Boys and girls need love, guarantees and availability. Nothing more", said the trans activist Mariela Muñoz in 2010 before a crowd in the Plaza de los Dos Congresos, in the middle of a party for the approval of Equal Marriage. The audience burst into applause. She insisted on something that was always her flag: the right of LGBT people to be mothers and fathers, to have a family, to give love and to raise children.
> 
> She did it with 23 children throughout her life, which ended on May 5, 2017. She was 74 years old. Although she had reached an advanced age (the life expectancy of a trans person is 35 years), she spent the last few years very ill, after suffering a stroke and losing various motor functions.
> 
> “It was the transvestite figure that linked gender with care and love for children. I remember that children and grandchildren appeared talking about Mariela as a mother and grandmother. For many of us it was to stop thinking of ourselves as people without parental rights and to break the stigma that LGBTs couldn't raise children,” Humberto Edgardo Corts, a referent of the Elders in Diversity group , told Presentes.
> 
> Advanced and emblematic
> Muñoz was born in Lules, Tucumán, and came to public attention when in 1993 a Quilmes juvenile judge decided to take away the custody of three children that Muñoz raised as his own and sentenced her to a suspended prison year. Four years later, she became the first trans person to have a DNI with her identity. 
> 
> Based on several psychological reports, Judge Jorge Dreyer, of Quilmes Court No. 8, ordered the Civil Registry to change his identity. Among his arguments, he maintained that his psychological sex was female since childhood and prior to the surgical intervention that had been carried out in Chile in the 1980s. This case marked jurisprudence and was taken as a precedent for the request to change the identity of several trans people. " I hope there are more transsexuals behind me and that they can do it by law," she said when she was invited to Mirtha Legrand's program .
> 
> “Her life was an example of struggle for many of us since through her visibility she managed to install the discussion of gender identity in the media. She was a fighter who helped write the history of the fight for gender identity. We need a Comprehensive Trans Law that repairs the suffering that we lived through for many years of our lives and that allows us to live our old age fully”, they said from the Association of Transvestites, Transsexuals and Transgenders of Argentina (ATTTA).
> 
> social indifference
> In addition to being an advisor to the Institute against Discrimination (INADI), in 1997 she was a candidate for Mayor of Quilmes. In the 2003 elections, she ran for provincial deputy for the Justicialist Party with the slogan "A different woman" and then in 2009 for the Renovador Party.
> 
> Based on the amparo actions presented by the Argentine LGBT Federation (FALGBT) and the Association of Transvestites, Transsexuals and Transgender of Argentina (ATTTA), in 2013 Judge María Elena Liberatori ordered that the Buenos Aires government grant “extraordinary subsidies and reparations” to her and four other older trans women, a pension that recognized her as a survivor. But activists pointed out that she never received it and that she died destitute.
> 
> “Until victory always dear Mariela Muñoz! A great fighter and historical reference of the #LGBTI movement who will accompany us forever in our struggle and militancy”, they said from the Argentine Homosexual Community (CHA).



> Mariela Munoz | Iconic trans activist and mother of 23 children

Her father forced her to go to a psychiatrist and, as if that were not enough for her, he also made her visit several cabarets with the intention of "straightening out" her gender and identity.
> 
> Thanks to his strength and conviction, he achieved the support of his family. Finally, she was accepted as what she always was, a woman.
> 
> At the age of 15, Mariela began to have her first jobs, among them, caring for a sick woman who had two children: one six years old and the other two years old. Due to her mother's condition, she began to take care of them, but with time they grew up and he stopped seeing them.
> 
> At 21, he moved to a house that he managed to buy with great effort in Florencio Varela. It was there that he began to receive children in his house, whom he mothered from minute 0.
> 
> The first was a teenager, the son of a prostitute who could not take care of him and decided to give him up . The second , a young woman he found at the neighborhood train station, with a helpless baby in her arms . Muñoz took charge of both. .
> 
> With unimaginable strength, Mariela raised 23 sons and daughters throughout her life and, in her last years, up to 30 grandchildren.
> On May 17, 1993, the police appeared at his house in an extremely violent display. They arrested her and separated her from three of her children.
> 
> She was sentenced to a one year suspended prison sentence . She was accused of kidnapping, of being a dangerous transsexual who would harm them and that unfortunate fact was a door to start externalizing her story in the media. 
> 
> Such was her relevance in society, that a few years later the host Mirtha Legrand wanted to receive her at her table, to listen to her tragic experiences.
> 
> After the sentence, they forbade him to see his children and that was when he went out to fight for them. Argentina was now aware of a revolutionary life story and she had to face a debate that had never been raised before: Can a trans person be a mother?
> 
> What is obvious to us today was unthinkable back then . The stigma on the trans community was much more radical and they were condemned without even hearing what they had to say.
> 
> The first trans woman with a female ID
> In 1997, Mariela, already with the sex change operation and starring in several well-known magazine covers, was invited again to Mirtha Legrand's program, who began the program with her document in hand.
> 
> "This is impressive. I have never seen such a case. He is a revolutionary " , he said, while reading "Mariela Muñoz, Argentina, Tucuman".
> 
> La Gigante was the first person in the country to get a gender and name change on the National Identity Document with the support of INADI. But, far from settling down and resting after so many struggles, Mariela put her body to fight the Gender Identity Law , because she, more than anyone, knew the need for so many others that would come her way.
> 
> His militancy, as we know, was not in vain. In 2012 , the Gender Identity Law was enacted.
> 
> In 2003, at the age of 70, Mariela suffered a stroke that affected her hearing, vision and mobility . A judge granted her an extraordinary subsidy and reparation for the discrimination to which the State, the law and negligence had subjected her . She was then 70 years old. Again, a historic event in our country.
> 
> Four years later, at the age of 73 and a life full of violence and harassment, M ariela Muñoz left this world, leaving us with a path cleared of so many stones that she decided to face without fear . Mariela Muñoz, she will accompany us forever in our struggle and militancy.
