NOT ON TDOR LIST

A transgender woman has died in her cell in an all male prison.
Martin Eatough, also know as Jade, was found dead inside her cell during a routine check.

She was in an all male prison after being convicted of rape. She was found in her cell in Parkhurst jail, Isle of Wight.

Eatough who was 35-years-old, killed herself inside her cell. She was in the first stage of gender reassignment and taking hormones.

She is the fourth transgender person to kill themselves in an all male prison in the last couple of years.

According to the Mirror, a source said:

“She was not on a suicide watch and was living normally.

“An officer checked her but got no response, entered the cell and found her.”

She was found during a routine check at 5am. Paramedics tried to resuscitate her but she was declared dead at 5:45am.

Although Eatough had not undergone gender reassignment surgery, she was living as a woman inside the prison.

This is the latest of four suicides by transgender people inside prison which has brought on criticism of the Prison Service.

Joanne Latham was found hanging inside her prison cell at a high security facility in Milton Keynes in November 2015.

Just a month prior to that Vikki Thompson, a 21-year-old transgender, killed herself in HMP Leeds.

Eatough was serving a life sentence for committing to sex attacks in the same night.

In 2005, he followed a 19-year-old girl in Blackburn and then assaulted her on her doorstep.

He raped a 15-year-old less than two hours later near Blackburn town centre.

Judge Slinger told Eatough that the first attack might have been much worse and the second victim had been terrified and humiliated.

The judge added that there was a “real and significant risk or further very serious offences being committed by you”.

Prisoners are held at the prison of their gender unless they have "gender recognition certificate" that states otherwise.

A Prison Service spokesperson said: “HMP Parkhurst prisoner Jade Eatough died in custody on Saturday 19 August 2017.

“As with all deaths in custody there will be an independent investigation by the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman.”
