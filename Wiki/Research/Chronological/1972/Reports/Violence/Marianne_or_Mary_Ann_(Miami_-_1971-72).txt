Serial killer Liberty City


The FBI believes that one of the 93 people Samuel Little strangled in the early ’70s was a black transgender woman he abducted from a bar in Liberty City, Florida. Little said that her name was Marianne or Mary Ann and that he killed her in 1972.

Just last year on November 4, 2020, Skylar Heath was murdered in Liberty City yet due to deadnaming and misgendering her death nearly went unreported.

Five years after analysts with the FBI’s Violent Criminal Apprehension Program (ViCAP) began linking cases to convicted murderer Samuel Little—and nearly 18 months after a Texas Ranger began to elicit from him a breathtaking number of confessions—the FBI has confirmed Little to be the most prolific serial killer in U.S. history.

Little has confessed to 93 murders, and FBI crime analysts believe all of his confessions are credible. Law enforcement has been able to verify 50 confessions, with many more pending final confirmation.

Little says he strangled his 93 victims between 1970 and 2005. Many of his victims’ deaths, however, were originally ruled overdoses or attributed to accidental or undetermined causes. Some bodies were never found.

The FBI and Miami-Dade Police are still working to discover the identity of a transgender woman believed to have been murdered by serial killer Samuel Little in the early 1970s. He believed her name was Marianne or Mary Ann.

New York Times: Samuel Little, the deadliest serial killer in American history, died Wednesday, November 30, 2020, at the age of 80, with police around the country still searching for his victims — women on the margins of society repeatedly failed by the criminal justice system.

“For many years, Samuel Little believed he would not be caught because he thought no one was accounting for his victims,” said ViCAP Crime Analyst Christie Palazzolo.

If you have information regarding a crime please report it to local and state law enforcement.

Violent criminals like Little murdered us without serving a single day in prison but that began to change when we started to integrate with society in the early 80s. The trans community now has trans-led and staffed organizations of retired law enforcement professionals called TCOPS.

Trans Death Investigations is brought to you by TCOPS International and the “Special Projects Group.” The group is comprised of retired and former police and sheriff’s detectives and retired and former federal investigators who are trans* themselves or who are proven close allies of the LGBTQ+ community.

They have an understandable interest in the deaths of trans* and gender-diverse individuals, and they understand the justice system and how homicide and death investigations work. This enables them to interact with local, state, and federal law enforcement on a peer/professional level and hopefully open communications regarding these cases.

The mission of the group is to gather facts; including tips, background information, or other related leads in the unsolved deaths of trans* individuals and gender-diverse individuals from members of the trans* community, the broader LGBTQ+ community, and allies.



Samuel Little told investigators that Mary Ann/ Marianne was a Black trans woman of 18 or 19. She was living with roommates in the Miami Dade, Florida area in 1971 or 1972, at the time of her murder. 1 800 CALL FBI  w any tips or info on this unmatched confession. #coldcase


Among the five new sketches released to the public, one depicts a transgender woman named Marianne that Mr. Little met in Miami in 1971 or 1972. Mr. Little said she was 18 or 19 years old and they met at a bar. He offered her a ride home in his gold Pontiac LeMans, then drove to what might have been a sugar cane field near Highway 27, where he killed her, according to the auth


Little said he met the woman in a bar called The Pool or Pool Place in either 1971 or 1972 and that her name was Marianne. He believes she had a boyfriend or ex-boyfriend called Wes.

Marianne reportedly lived with a group of transgender women in the Liberty City or Brownsville areas of Miami.

In his confession, Little said he was driving in his car – a gold Pontiac – with Marianne when he pulled off Highway 27. He brought her to a place that may have been a sugarcane field where he strangled her. He said he left her body off a dirt road on the way to a swamp.
