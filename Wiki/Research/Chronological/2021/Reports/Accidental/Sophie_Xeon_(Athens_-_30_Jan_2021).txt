SOPHIE death: Pioneering musician and DJ dies in ‘sudden accident’, aged 34
Producer was considered one of modern day music’s leading talents

The music world has been left shaken by the news that SOPHIE has died, aged 34.

Scottish musician, DJ and record producer SOPHIE was commonly regarded to be one of the most important figures working in electronic pop music today.

The news was confirmed by her team, who wrote: “It is with profound sadness that I have to inform you that musician and producer SOPHIE passed away this morning around 4am in Athens, where the artist had been living, following a sudden accident.

“At this time respect and privacy for the family is our priority. We would also ask for respect for her fanbase, and to treat the private nature of this news with sensitivity.”

The statement continued: “SOPHIE was a pioneer of a new sound, one of the most influential artists in the last decade. Not only for ingenious production and creativity but also for the message and visibility that was achieved. An icon of liberation.”


SOPHIE shot to fame with the songs “Bipp” and “Lemonade” and received acclaim for her 2018 Grammy nominated debut album Oil of Every Pearl's Un-Insides.

The nomination saw her become the first openly trans artist to be nominated for Best Dance/Electronic Album.

SOPHIE – real name Sophie Xeon – kept her identity hidden until the release of a music video for “It’s Okay to Cry” in 2017.  

Until then, many reports had attempted to guess who she was.

The musicians she worked alongside throughout her career included Lady Gaga, Nicki Minaj and Madonna.

Paying tribute to the musician, French singer-songwriter Christine and the Queens hailed Sophie as “a stellar producer, a visionary [and] a reference”.

She added: “She rebelled against the narrow, normative society by being an absolute triumph, both as an artist and as a woman. I can’t believe she is gone. We need to honor and respect her memory and legacy. Cherish the pioneers.”




Scottish singer, producer and DJ Sophie died at age 34. The death was mourned by the PAN label and by close friends of her, this Saturday (30).

According to the Future Cassic label, she died after climbing higher to see the full moon, when she slipped and fell. She lived in Athens, Greece.

The artist's staff confirmed the death shortly after, citing "a sudden accident" this morning. "Right now, respect and privacy for the family are our priority. We would also ask for respect from your fans to treat the private nature of this news with sensitivity."

The artist's team also wrote that Sophie "pioneered a new sound, one of the most influential artists of the past decade".

"Not only for ingenious production and creativity, but also for the message and visibility that has been achieved. An icon of liberation."

Sophie Xeon was born in Glasgow, Scotland, and made pop music that carried the weight of synthesizers.

In 2019, she was nominated for a Grammy for Best Dance and Electronic Album for her debut album "Oil of Every Pearl's Un-Insides". With the feat, she became the first transgender artist to have a nomination in the biggest music award.

"Being trans is something that is gaining strength and it is to put your body more in line with your soul and spirit so that the two do not fight against each other and struggle to survive," she said in a recent interview.

"We are all beings that think and feel, in a very complex world and we should use all the technologies and information around us to adapt to this world."

Madonna and Charli XCX
In addition to her solo career, Sophie also worked writing and producing for other artists. She was one of the authors and producers of "Vroom Vroom", the title track of Charli XCX's EP, with whom she would work again many times.

The singer was also one of the names behind "Bitch, I'm Madonna", a single recorded by the queen of pop alongside Nicki Minaj. The song was one of the singles from the 2015 album "Rebel Heart".
