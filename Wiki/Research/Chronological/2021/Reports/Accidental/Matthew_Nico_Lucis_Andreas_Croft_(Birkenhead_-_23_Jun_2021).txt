A heartbroken mum paid tribute to her 'gorgeous lad' who died accidentally aged just 27.

Matthew Nico Lucis Andreas Croft was found at home and rushed to Arrowe Park Hospital in Wirral where he died on June 23.

The 27-year-old suffered a series of unimaginable tragedies growing up, starting when his dad was brutally murdered when Matthew was still just a child

Liverpool Coroner's Court heard Matthew was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and psychosis classified as emotional unstable personality disorder.

Computer game enthusiast Matthew was transgender and he had one of his final gender reassignment procedures cancelled and postponed due to delays caused by the Covid pandemic.

Matthew's mum, Michelle Hazlehurst, spoke to the ECHO after the inquest hearing in Kirkdale, and said: "My son has a tough upbringing, he was only small when these tragedies happened.

"He made the transition from a girl to a boy when he was doing his GCSEs.

"He was diagnosed with bipolar when he was at university.

"Matthew was a gorgeous lad, a straight A star student.

"In 2016 he came out as transgender and [became] Matthew.

"I accepted him for everything.

"He got A stars at A Level and went to Leicester University to study computer game design.

"He also got his Masters."

The 50-year-old added: "He only had a short life - I loved the bones of him.

"He was due to have another operation to do with being transgender, but it was cancelled due to Covid.

"Matthew had a lovely personality, he was bubbly and would always make you laugh."

An ambulance arrived at his home in Leasowe on June 23 and he was provided with oxygen and taken to Arrowe Park Hospital where he underwent CPR, but he died later.

Coroner Andre Rebello told the Kirkdale hearing: "I think Matthew had been managing his pain and taking a painkiller for a long time.

"It was chronic [...] use and it damaged his liver.

"His death was definitely accidental, he hasn't tried to harm himself.

"He may well have been upset about something, but he didn't purposely take his own life."

A conclusion of accidental death was recorded.
