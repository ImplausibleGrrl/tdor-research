> 
> In this regard, the plaintiff's attorney commented that “at first, she suffered a panic attack. Instead of using certain mechanisms that have to do with mental health, the police used institutional force. When the uniformed men arrived at the house, she had a scissor in her hands and the long one, at which point the police grab her and drag her through the house, causing her to bump into the walls and tables, and even smash a fish tank. They take it out on the sidewalk and reduce it ”.
> 
> “Vicky weighed like 40 kilos and five policemen jumped on her. At that moment, the young woman stops breathing. His mother and his partner experienced these acts of violence, ”he said. On the preliminary report of the autopsy, Cozzi, added that “she had a hemorrhage so there are doubts. The conclusion that we draw for the moment is that, if the police had not used force, today Vicky would be alive ”.

> For her part, attorney Ema commented that this case highlights the lack of protocol for action in cases of mental health crisis. “There is a paradigm that is approached as a criminal issue and it is a health issue. We have to start looking at the situation in a different way, because we have provincial laws regarding mental health ”.

> Meanwhile, I indicated that “before the violent deaths of trans people, one must always presume, above all that it is a transfemicide. Thus, throughout the investigation, other hypotheses are discarded. Above all, you have to look at gender perspectives ”. Elonce.com
