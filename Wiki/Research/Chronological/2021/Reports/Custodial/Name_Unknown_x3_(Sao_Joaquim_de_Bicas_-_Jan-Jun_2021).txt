suicide


> A morbid suicide calendar has been registered since the beginning of the year within LGBTQI+ wards at the São Joaquim de Bicas Penitentiary, in the metropolitan region of Minas Gerais. The cases began in January, when a person took his own life. In April, the fact was repeated, and there were two more self-exterminations in May, another in June, the sixth suicide in July and another one recorded last Saturday. Officially, it is not known what led gay, transsexual and transvestite detainees to commit suicide.
> 
> The Civil Police has not yet completed the investigations. After five suicides, the Public Defender of Minas Gerais filed a lawsuit asking for urgent improvements to the unit, called Professor Jason Soares Albergaria. The Minas Gerais Court of Justice (TJMG) accepted the request, and the state government guarantees that it is taking appropriate measures. After the action of the Public Defender's Office, two other suicides and six self-extermination attempts were recorded. As soon as the deaths surfaced, the Secretariat of Justice and Public Security (Sejusp) determined that the unit would be dedicated exclusively to the LGBTQI+ public. The penitentiary currently houses 396 inmates.
> 
> The deaths involve people between 20 and 32 years of age and are accompanied by several complaints by family members and ex-detainees. There are stories of abuse, precarious medical care, food and hygiene conditions. For the Public Defender's Office, there was an omission, in addition to the suspicion that some cases are disguised homicides.
> 
> “The agents make fun of us, they treat us like animals. I still have nightmares,” says a young transsexual who was only three days inside. For Cristina Oliveira, a transsexual who spent about six years in the penitentiary, the daily torment resulted in her partner's death. He was also in prison and committed suicide after an alleged crisis. Cristina herself assumes that she had already attempted self-extermination after being sentenced to 17 years in prison. “Life had become small for me”, he recalls.
