> Drafting THE COMMERCE (I)
> He was 20 years old when he decided to give way to his transformation. Her predilection for the feminine and her delicate treatment cost her pain, rejection, loneliness ... Nothing prevented her skin from giving space to the name she chose: Helen .
> 
> Each letter was engraved on his arm along with ink-stained stars. That is now one of the few signs to identify his remains . Helen Maldonado was murdered on the violent night of November 12, 2021, in the Litoral Penitentiary .
> 
> He died 17 days before his 29th birthday. He was serving a 30-month prison sentence after a few grams of H.
> 
> Before the massacre , she and other trans-women asked for help . Odalys Cayambe says that they knew that a new bloody attack was being prepared and they begged for their passage a few meters from the Peni, to the priority area of ​​the Regional prison, where the sentence for the Glbti population is a little more bearable.  
> 
> “Helen is just the voice of what we have asked the State for years: respect for identity, gender expression, clothing in the prison system. We are and were there - in men's prisons - because we have a penis; the rest don't matter to them ”.
> 
> Odalys directs the Trans Community Network of Ecuador Vivir Libre , which since 2017 has supported more than 200 transsexual women who were and are incarcerated for street fights, drug use or because they are accused of robbery by clients seeking sexual services.
> 
> That is how he met Helen, in ward 6. He still does not know how he got to the transitional area, where she was massacred.
> 
> The torture , says Odalys, begins much earlier, since they set foot in the cells. “Being inside is a matter of survival, of existing and resisting. One way of resisting is prostitution, they are forced to be slaves of the system, to be mules… ”.
> 
> Helen's crime uncovers 12 other stories of murders and violent deaths so far in 2021, of members of the Glbti community . 
> 
> The report 'Runa Sipiy Ecuador' , prepared by the Silhouette X Association, registered another 15 deaths in the country in 2020 that have not been clarified. While between 2010 and 2019 they detected 58 murders.
> 
> “Since 2010 we have identified these cases and the progress is not clear. We do not know if they are still in a previous investigation, if they were appealed or if there are sentenced. The prosecutor must open ex officio investigations if our family does not want to know anything about us as a community , "says Diane Rodriguez, president of Silhouette X .
> 
> The square located in front of the Guayas Prosecutor's Office was covered the previous week with crosses , by Helen, Wilson, Angelo ... Days later they unveiled a mural at the headquarters of Silhouette X, also with crosses, to denounce the violence they are experiencing. This November 20, 2021 they join a national march to demand the fulfillment of their rights.
> 
> In recent years, crimes against the community have taken a turn. They no longer happen from street brawls or homophobic attacks. Now the main suspects are their partners . "It is similar to the cases of femicide, they are transfemicides."
> 
> Wilson was assassinated in the early morning of July 12. That night they saw the man leave his apartment who five years earlier had left him on the brink of death after a brutal beating. A few days ago, his sister Flora Guillen discovered in the pages of the record the report of the autopsy : broke his skull, his face was disfigured, his arms were broken, was also slain.
> 
> "He was like my son and I want justice to be served," says Flora. A friend told me that they die like this, betrayed, because they do not see evil in people. Those words gave me peace and strength to find the culprit. " Since the death, she has sought clues and witnesses to move the case forward.
> 
> Helen's family does not think about lawsuits for now . Until they find her body, they have a faint hope of finding her alive, in some ward of the troubled Penitentiary . There he had served half his sentence and hoped to apply for pre-release , a process that in the end was so costly that he gave up.
> 
> “We don't even have his body to be able to cry in his grave and assimilate that he is no longer there,” says a broken relative. "We thought we would identify her by her tattoos, the one on her arm and another on her back, but there are still several cremated bodies."


> In the Litoral Penitentiary there is a pavilion where people from the LGBTIQ + community can serve their sentences. However, as long as there is no verdict, like the other detainees, they must wait in the transitional wing. Helen Brigitte Maldonado , a trans woman from Manabí, a province on the Ecuadorian coast, had been in “la lagartera” for more than a year. This November he was going to turn 29 years old.
> 
> Diane Rodriguez , national director of the Ecuadorian Federation of LGBTI Organizations, recalls that Helen Maldonado arrived in Guayaquil and worked in a hairdresser and also worked as a sex worker. Helen was arrested for micro-trafficking of drugs and was serving a sentence of two and a half years, according to information published by the digital medium EdicionCientonce , which also indicates that in March 2022, Helen could request a change to the semi-open rehabilitation regime , which consists of to serve the rest of the sentence outside of prison with family, labor, social or community reintegration activities.
> 
> Although Helen was not an activist in the LGBTI community, "she knew about and was linked to organizational spaces, but she did not articulate as an activist, " says Diane. Community members who knew her, says Diane, remember that Helen was a shy person and that her arrest was a surprise, because she was not linked to any gang.
> 
> When the massacre started, Helen was able to call her mother and tell her what was happening, Diane recalls. Helen's mother and sister lived through the ordeal of families searching for the bodies of their loved ones. Both had to identify Helen's body, first among the remains of those who were dismembered, not finding her there, they were taken with the cremated bodies, where they recognized her.
> 
> According to a report published in Indómita , one day before the massacre, “Helen Brigitte took a photo, in profile, smiling, loose hair, shorts and a red, white and blue striped diver and sent it by WhatsApp to a group of friends with two words: "I'm fine ." Shots had already been heard all week in the Litoral Penitentiary.
> 
> Despite the fact that Helen was a trans woman, she was being held in a men's prison. Their story is a "voice", Odalys Cayambe , director of the trans organization Vivir Libres, told local media. The mistreatment that Helen received as a person of gender diversity, also happens with 60 other trans women who are in the Penitentiary , according to Cayambe told Indómita .




[The country's prison system has been under a state of exception since September 29 after the worst prison massacre recorded in the country, which took place in this Guayaquil prison]


Helen Maldonado was 29 years old, a trans woman and one of the 68 people deprived of liberty brutally murdered on the night of November 12, 2021, during the last massacre at the Litoral Penitentiary, in the Guayas province.

Maldonado occupied a cell in ward 2 where the highest number of deaths was recorded. She was imprisoned for possession of 'H', "for consumption not for sale," says Odalys Cayambe , spokeswoman for the trans women's organization "Vivir Libre", who since Saturday has been attending the police forensic center to recognize her body .

Helen had served 14 months of the 30 in prison to which she was sentenced. It has not yet been possible to recognize a tattoo on a body that "she had on her hand and back," says Cayambe , who suspects that Helen would be one of the people whose bodies were cremated.

According to Cayambe, before her death, Helen would have experienced several scenes of horror inside the jail, due to the mistreatment that LGBTI people constantly suffer in these centers, despite the existence of a protocol of care for this minority population that establishes the location of the persons deprived of liberty due to registration of sex (female-male) and gender (female-male).

Cayambe criticizes that there has never been an exclusive space for LGBTI people in jail, "since they are constantly victims of violence." "Helen expressed herself as a woman and there was never a guarantee or defense for her," she adds.

Who also had no guarantees was Erick Ortíz, who was imprisoned for having a drug bag, but despite serving his sentence, he was not released on time. His release ticket arrived last Friday at the penitentiary, the same day he was murdered. His departure was stalled amid the bureaucratic paperwork of the system, said relatives of the victim. However, according to Fundación Dignidad, this would happen because the SNAI "rarely deals with freedoms on weekends."

On the outskirts of the police forensic center, the heartbreaking scenes of relatives crying to the victims are repeated, after the massacre of September 28 of this year in which 119 prisoners were deprived of liberty.

According to Assemblyman Héctor Vanegas , among the victims is John Campusano , an accountant for the Ecuagran company, who was serving preventive detention for the purchase of negotiable obligations and commercial invoices from Ecuagran and Delcorp, which record defaults on the stock market.




Ecuadorian human rights organizations denounced this Sunday that among those killed in the context of the massacre in Guayaquil, with 68 dead there would be activists and human rights defenders.

According to the Alliance Against Prisons, of Ecuador, they have confirmed the murder of the activist for water, Víctor Guaillas, in the massacre on Saturday, who was also a person with a disability and had been denied habeas corpus.

The alliance itself denounced that several of the deceased did not have a sentence and also, a trans person who should have been in a women's ward was murdered.
