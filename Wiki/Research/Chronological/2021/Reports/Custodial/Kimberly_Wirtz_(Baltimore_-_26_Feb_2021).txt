26 Feb 2021
Baltimore
Maryland
USA
died in custody


Kimberly died alone in a prision cell in a male prison. The authorities refused to tell her family why she was arrested or how she died.

> On Thursday February 26, Kim Wirtz's niece received a devastating call from the chaplain of the Baltimore City Central Booking Unit informing them that their Aunt, Kim a transgender woman, was found unresponsive in a single cell of a male prison at midnight. She was later pronounced dead at 1:16am at Mercy Hospital.
> 
> STILL AS OF NOW THEY HAVE NOT BEEN GIVEN A CAUSE OF DEATH & The jail refuses to give them any detailed report Of the "incident" until they acquire an attorney. Unfortunately, because of the untimeliness of Kim's death, they simply are not equipped to cover the cost and expenses of her arrangements let alone legal counsel.
> 
> TODAY WE DEMAND ANSWERS FOR THE FAMILY AND THE UNTIMELY DEMISE OF OUR FALLEN SISTER!!!!!
