Penitenciaría del Litoral de Ecuador
Guayaquil
Ecuador
died in custody





[The country's prison system has been under a state of exception since September 29 after the worst prison massacre recorded in the country, which took place in this Guayaquil prison]


Helen Maldonado was 29 years old, a trans woman and one of the 68 people deprived of liberty brutally murdered on the night of November 12, 2021, during the last massacre at the Litoral Penitentiary, in the Guayas province.

Maldonado occupied a cell in ward 2 where the highest number of deaths was recorded. She was imprisoned for possession of 'H', "for consumption not for sale," says Odalys Cayambe , spokeswoman for the trans women's organization "Vivir Libre", who since Saturday has been attending the police forensic center to recognize her body .

Helen had served 14 months of the 30 in prison to which she was sentenced. It has not yet been possible to recognize a tattoo on a body that "she had on her hand and back," says Cayambe , who suspects that Helen would be one of the people whose bodies were cremated.

According to Cayambe, before her death, Helen would have experienced several scenes of horror inside the jail, due to the mistreatment that LGBTI people constantly suffer in these centers, despite the existence of a protocol of care for this minority population that establishes the location of the persons deprived of liberty due to registration of sex (female-male) and gender (female-male).

Cayambe criticizes that there has never been an exclusive space for LGBTI people in jail, "since they are constantly victims of violence." "Helen expressed herself as a woman and there was never a guarantee or defense for her," she adds.

Who also had no guarantees was Erick Ortíz, who was imprisoned for having a drug bag, but despite serving his sentence, he was not released on time. His release ticket arrived last Friday at the penitentiary, the same day he was murdered. His departure was stalled amid the bureaucratic paperwork of the system, said relatives of the victim. However, according to Fundación Dignidad, this would happen because the SNAI "rarely deals with freedoms on weekends."

On the outskirts of the police forensic center, the heartbreaking scenes of relatives crying to the victims are repeated, after the massacre of September 28 of this year in which 119 prisoners were deprived of liberty.

According to Assemblyman Héctor Vanegas , among the victims is John Campusano , an accountant for the Ecuagran company, who was serving preventive detention for the purchase of negotiable obligations and commercial invoices from Ecuagran and Delcorp, which record defaults on the stock market.




Ecuadorian human rights organizations denounced this Sunday that among those killed in the context of the massacre in Guayaquil, with 68 dead there would be activists and human rights defenders.

According to the Alliance Against Prisons, of Ecuador, they have confirmed the murder of the activist for water, Víctor Guaillas, in the massacre on Saturday, who was also a person with a disability and had been denied habeas corpus.

The alliance itself denounced that several of the deceased did not have a sentence and also, a trans person who should have been in a women's ward was murdered.
