> Image of Trinidadian LGBTQ + activist Brandy Rodriguez taken from a YouTube profile video for International Women's Day, through the Soyini Nneka channel.
> 
> Brandy Rodriguez , one of Trinidad and Tobago's most outspoken trans and LGBTQ + activists, has passed away. His friends described his departure on the morning of October 28 as "sudden", sparking a wave of condolences on social media.
> 
> Many will remember Rodriguez as a fervent defender of human rights and supporter of trans rights. The Trinidad and Tobago Transgender Coalition (which he chaired) posted photos of their "brave leader" as he received the 180th Commonwealth of Nations Points of Light certificate. The award recognizes his service to vulnerable local trans and LGBTQ + communities, who by they are generally marginalized and try to survive on the fringes of society. It was an honor that many perceived as "incredible and well deserved" as he celebrates inspiring acts of volunteer work throughout the Commonwealth regarding pressing social challenges.
> 
> Harriet Cross, the British High Commissioner in Trinidad and Tobago, who presented the award to Rodriguez, was saddened to learn of his passing:
> 
> I feel incredibly saddened to learn from Jason Jones (NE: LGBTQ + human rights defender) that Brandy Rodriguez has passed away. Her Majesty the Queen recognized Brandy's exceptional work in serving the trans community and LGBTQ + rights with the Points of Light award from the Commonwealth of Nations. Brandy was royalty from Trinidad and Tobago üáπüáπand I am proud to have met her.
> 
> Rodriguez's passing is a great loss to the local LGBTQ + community, in part due to the vast local reach of his work. For more than 20 years, she helped create safe spaces and economic opportunities for trans women, many of whom turned to prostitution for lack of alternatives. He also made many contributions to HIV positive people , leading to an initiative to ensure that they receive all necessary medication and to promote an end to the stigmatization of the disease.
> 
> When he received the Points of Light award in early 2021, Rodriguez told Trinidad and Tobago's Newsday newspaper that it only gave him a further boost to continue his work:
> 
> This award will allow me to continue demonstrating the importance of including all people, especially the trans community. I will also use it to focus attention on the importance of sexual and reproductive human rights. I know that together we can create a [Trinidad and Tobago] where everyone is comfortable and free to be who they are.
> 
> In commemoration of International Women's Day 2020 in Trinidad and Tobago, Rodriguez's consultancy work for the Trinidad and Tobago Coalition of Sex Workers was highlighted, as well as her tireless leadership in the Trinidad and Tobago Transgender Coalition, which she led from 2017 until his death:
> 
> She led the efforts in the intervention of NGOs, Governments and key population groups through the empowerment of communities and has been a fundamental representative in the advancement of Trans rights in Trinidad and Tobago. Her work has helped reduce the exclusion, discrimination and violence of marginalized groups, especially trans women.
> 
> Brandy  is phenomenal for her courage, humility, altruism and the fact that she is committed to empowering the lives of those voices that are not heard.
> 
> Rodriguez dedicated his life to ending discrimination in the LGBTQ + community and ensuring that its members have equal and appropriate access to health services and economic opportunities. In the words of Jason Jones, who successfully dismantled very outdated anti-homosexuality laws in Trinidad and Tobago in a 2018 court victory that declared those laws unconstitutional:
> 
> Brandy has been a pillar of our community for decades and made great strides in the fight for equality and freedom for LGBTQ + citizens. His fight for trans rights and his indomitable spirit will never be forgotten or replaced. It was truly unique. Rest in peace, Brandy.
