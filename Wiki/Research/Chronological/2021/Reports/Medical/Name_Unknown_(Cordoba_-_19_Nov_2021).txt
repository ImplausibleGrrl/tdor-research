A trans woman in her 40s was found dead in the room she occupied in a hotel in the city of Córdoba and the police are trying to determine the cause of death.

At first it was reported that the victim had been shot in the head, but the Homicide Division of the Police denied that version. However, the case is surrounded by questions and so far the only precise thing is that the investigators ruled out that it was a violent death since no signs of an attack were observed.

The case began to be investigated after the call of the person in charge of the place to the police. It was at 8 am this Friday when police personnel arrived at the Residencial Amanecer hotel, located at 359 Catamarca street, in the center of the city of Córdoba.

"They called because they felt a nauseating smell from one of the rooms," Major Commissioner Cristian Mazza told ElDoce.tv.

The agents arrived at the hotel and after several minutes they were able to enter the room where they found that the body of a woman of approximately 40 years was found. "The body was covering the door, so it was not easy to enter," explained the commissioner.

Other people who knew the woman said that she suffered from chronic diseases . The officers ruled out a violent event inside the room and in principle it would be a natural death.

On the other hand, the death would have occurred four or five days ago, according to estimates from the Homicide division of the Córdoba Police, which is investigating the cause of death.



This Friday, the victim was found in a room at the Hotel Residencial Amanecer.
