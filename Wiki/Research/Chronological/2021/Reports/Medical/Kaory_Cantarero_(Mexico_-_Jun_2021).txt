> Mexico. At dawn on June 22, Kaory Cantarero, a 27-year-old trans woman from Honduras, died of a heart attack at a rehabilitation center in the State of Mexico. The Mexican activist Kenya Cuevas claimed his body and requested his repatriation, however, the Honduran consulate denied this service for not complying with the protocol.

They accepted it, cared for it, checked it and realized that it arrived very deteriorated. On the admission sheet they found bumps and bruises from so much convulsion, ”Kenya explains in an interview.
> 
> During her stay at the rehabilitation center, Kaory suffered seizures and delusions and in the early morning of Tuesday, June 22, she suffered a sudden heart attack. "Speaking with the coroner, she told me that she already had several pre-infarctions but this was the one that ended her life," adds the activist.

Within minutes, Kenya Cuevas was notified and she in turn contacted Kaory's mother, who resides in Spain. “When I gave him the news, he got sick and told me that he wanted to see his daughter, so we linked her by video call with the group (rehabilitation center),” says Kenya.

> Consulate denies repatriation of Kaory
> Kenya had to get the personal number of the Honduran consul in Mexico, Gabriel Rubio, because when dialing the Consulate they did not answer. After multiple unsuccessful attempts, the official finally replied: "the repatriation will no longer be possible on our part because you did not respect the protocol."
> 
> Presentes managed to contact Miriam Ávalos, consular assistant, and she replied the same: "Miss Kenya did not respect protocol." When questioning why, he said that “for repatriation to be carried out, notification must be made at the time a national dies so that the Consulate is in charge of recognizing the body, removing it from SEMEFO and carrying out the proceedings. Once the relatives removed him or have him watching, they can no longer come and tell us 'we want you to pay to send him to Honduras', because that is not the protocol followed by the Foreign Ministry.

> 
> When applying for the body, Kenya did so as a civil organization that has this power, not as a family member. Likewise, the Law for the Protection of Honduran Migrants and their Families mentions that “the resources of the Fund for Solidarity with the Honduran Migrants (FOSMIH) will be used to repatriate the bodies of Hondurans who died abroad and whose families do not have the resources to do so. ”.

Despite this, the repatriation payment to the funeral home that still conserves Kaory will not be borne by the Consulate of Honduras in Mexico but thanks to the support of the International Committee of the Red Cross. The funeral home has not yet given a date for the repatriation.

> Kaory fled Honduras due to threats
> “She was very charismatic, for everything I found the joke, she laughed a lot, she was also very supportive”, this is how Kenya Cuevas remembers her, who knew Kaory closely because she was inside the Casa Hogar Paola Buenrostro, a shelter for trans women, founded for her.
> 
> 
> The flowers on Kaory's coffin carried messages of mourning.
> In 2011 Kaory Cantarero had to leave San Pedro Sula, Honduras after receiving death threats, she was just 17 years old. That year and until 2015, that city was classified as the most violent in the world, according to the Citizen Council for Public Safety and Criminal Justice. Another factor in leaving your country is the prejudice violence that trans women face; From 2009 to 2020, the Lesbian Network Cattrachas registered 119 murders against trans people, mostly women.
> 
> “Among the causes that force a trans woman to leave are structural violence, the absence of political will to create and implement laws for the benefit of this population. Honduras does not have laws that protect LGBTI + people and, in particular, trans people, they are not even recognized, ”said Osman Lara, a Honduran LGBT activist teaching social sciences and international migration, in an interview.
> 
> On her birthday, August 29, Kaory decided to "leave the shelter." A few weeks after leaving, he began to live on the streets, to consume alcohol and to engage in sex work in the Revolución metro area in Mexico City.
> 
> “During the Revolution days we tried to convince her to return (to the refuge), but there was always resistance and, I have always said, we have been dragging many monsters, things that have happened to us. And Kaory fell into a very deep depression because one of her brothers was murdered, that, plus the drug, the alcohol that is one of the first demands in sex work to endure. All this wraps you in a vicious circle, and it is very difficult to get out of there and from a life totally precarious with rights, ”says Kenya.

In all that time I was also ticking and ticking and dialing the Honduran Consulate and they never answered me, ”says Kenya in an interview.
> 
> Kenya says it is disappointed, as there were no responses to the call for support. “I am outraged by the entire LGBT community and activists. There was no support whatsoever, neither in networks, nor at the wake, nobody cared, not even the march committee. The only ones who supported were CAIT, Hazando Calle, the same sex workers and a young man who brought coffee and stayed until three in the morning ”.
> 
> Kenya assumed the funeral expenses to watch Kaory in Mexico City: 5,000 pesos for two days, but it lasted four nights. When questioning why, she says “it is only in this way that people who did know her in Revolution could go to see her. She was not alone ”. Kaory was fired with imitation shows, music, and flower crowns.

> Outside Metro Revolución there is a small offering in memory of Kaory Cantarero, a 27-year-old trans woman from Honduras who died in Mexico, who after spending several days at the Rudiño Funeral Home, Venustiano Carranza mayor's office, was able to be repatriated to her country of origin.
> 
> “She was a very close friend and companion, her departure hurts me. God knows why he went to the other spiritual plane. We made this small memorial to him because this was our workplace, where he laughed and lived together every day. I never left the funeral home, because I know it is the last time I see her and because sometimes you have to replace the place of a mother who is far away, "said Esther, a sex worker and friend of Kaory in an interview with MILENIO .
> Due to the violence, Kaory fled her country at the age of 17. In Mexico, she faced discrimination and a lack of resources that led to her becoming a sex worker. Family and friends remember her as a happy and spontaneous person, “who filled the environment with color”. According to the testimonies of her companions, in the early hours of Tuesday she entered into auditory, visual, tremens delusions and finally suffered a heart attack; had an alcohol addiction.

He was a cute boy, he was very attentive. For my birthday, he was the first to give me gifts. In Honduras, his seven siblings and his father are waiting for him, ”said Gloria Esperanza Regalado, Kaory's mother, who is residing in Spain.

June 24, 2021 - 00:48
Mexico City, Jun 23 (EFE) .- Friends and relatives of Kaory Cantarero, a trans woman who died in Mexico, asked this Wednesday that she be repatriated to her country of origin, Honduras, but the consulate cannot afford it once the body, they explained to Eph.

"From the moment it goes through a funeral home, repatriation can no longer be taken into account by the Foreign Ministry," Miriam Ávalos, spokesperson for the Honduran embassy in Mexico, told Efe.

Cantarero died last Tuesday [22 or 15?] as a result of his addictions and Kenya Cuevas, a trans activist, took charge of the procedures "so that his body does not end up in a common grave."

Therefore, until this Wednesday they were watching her at a funeral home in the Mexican capital, hoping to bury her on Thursday if they did not get repatriation.

However, as explained by the embassy, once the body is transferred and funeral services are contracted, the Honduran Foreign Ministry can no longer afford the repatriation.

Asked about the reason for this situation, the official insisted that "they are the provisions of the Foreign Ministry."

Cantarero emigrated to Mexico at the age of 17. Due to the violence, she was displaced from her country and arrived in Mexico where she faced discrimination and violence and was placed in sex work and in the consumption of substances that led her to lose her life last Tuesday.

It was then that Cuevas intervened, but the embassy spokeswoman recalled that when they receive notification of the person's death, they contact the family to initiate the request.

The activist called the embassy on Wednesday and, as reported, it was already late because there was already a funeral home hired and the Honduran authorities could not act as they usually do.

"We (usually) make quotations with three funeral homes. We use the lowest cost one for repatriation, but if one has already been hired, the case is complicated," the official stressed.

However, Cuevas insisted that she "did not know that there was a procedure that had to be done" because once before she did it through the National Council to Prevent Discrimination (Conapred), whom she called on this occasion and was told that she was they would give an answer.

Even so, the Embassy of Honduras in Mexico explained that repatriation can be made if the family bears the expenses and that they can help them with bureaucratic issues.

"In the case if they want to repatriate him on behalf of the family or need something, let them come to us to see how we can support them," added Ávalos. EFE
