Safire was a civil servant at the Social Assistance Secretariat where she worked at Cras Itaipuaçu. It was the LGBT Forum in Maricá, always supporting and participating, disseminating our actions and fights against prejudice and for human rights. It was also affiliated with the Unified Black Movement MNU MNU Maricá.

We just have to thank immensely for the time we were able to live with her, who will always be remembered in our hearts, as a dedicated and loving companion. Yansa's Safire leaves an ANCESTRAL legacy of great importance to her Sons of Axé, Sons whom She loved dearly, and who transmitted her teachings. Go in peace mate.
