Laura Assis, teacher of São João da Barra, transsexual woman and lover of folk and folk arts dies
Laura Assis, a teacher from the São João da Barra public school system, died this Sunday (21). She is also President of CEPEG / Grussaí.

Laura was ill at home, the rescue was triggered but has already found her dead. 

Apparently she suffered either a cardiac arrest or a stroke, however, only the next procedures can attest to the cause of death. 

The body is still in the residence awaiting removal to the Legal Medical Institute (IML) in Campos. 

Data on wake and burial have not yet been released. Once we have it, it will be published here. 

NOTE FROM THE JOURNALIST
Laura was a friend of this. She was even here a few days ago at home, from where I write this disbelieving note, talking about future plans, about hope for better days with the arrival of the vaccine and with positive, happy messages. It was impossible not to laugh with the teacher, a transsexual woman and a lover of popular and folk arts, Laura Assis. Yesterday she was with her sister friend, Kíssila Rodrigues, by the bands of Grussaí. Through instagram status, I followed part of the fun of both. It was okay. Even fun to watch. I woke up with this news that friend Glaubia Sena put in a restricted group of ours and I confirmed, unfortunately, that this human being left us. They lose family, friends and all of São João da Barra. Rest in peace.
