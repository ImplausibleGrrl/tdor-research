COVID-19


Our beloved @karlaariellasleft us a victim of the actions of that genocidal and cruel government - yet another victim of COVID ! Very sad and revolting to know that she could have won more if she had been vaccinated.

Karla was a generous person, with an extraordinary strength who faced all prejudices in a haughty and courageous way. He was with us always supporting us, participating in our projects.

Our official DIGO diva - International Festival of Sexual and Gender Diversity of Goiás where she delivered the awards with great beauty and glamour. She never said no, always willing to help us and also to do another belly dancing performance - an art that was phenomenal and that mesmerized everyone.

So many plans and possibilities and now we can only thank for having met her with tears in her eyes and a sad heart to know that the world loses a star! Rest in peace, my dear friend.
