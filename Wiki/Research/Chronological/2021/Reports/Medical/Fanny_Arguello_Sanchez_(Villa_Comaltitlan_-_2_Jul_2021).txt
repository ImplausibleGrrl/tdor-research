Fanny Arguello Sánchez, president of the civil association "Diana Sacayán, transformarse es vivir" A.C ["Diana Sacayán, transforming is living" AC], died last Saturday due to Covid-19 in Villa Comaltitlán. Her death shocked the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transsexual, Transgender, Transvestite, Queer and Intersex (LGBTTTIQ +) defense organizations, who saw her as a promoter of the fight for human rights.

Arguello Sánchez founded this association and came to group up to more than 100 members, all in order to be represented. In their first demands, they called for an end to harassment and acts of violence during their working hours in sex work.

Later, after the support of Aida Jiménez Sesma, the "Trans Identity Law" was promoted , which sought to reform articles 41, 43 and 101, in addition to adding articles 101 bis and 101 ser of the civil code of the state of Chiapas , in order to guarantee the right to recognition of people's identity. However, since 2019 it has not advanced. The stagnation of said initiative represented the mobilization of Arguello and the members of said association.

The organization "Diana Sacayan" on several occasions condemned transfeminicides that occurred in the entity, at the same time, demanded justice given the impunity of the events.

The State Commission for Human Rights and the Network for Sexual Inclusion expressed their consternation at the death and recognized his work on behalf of the transgender population in Chiapas.

The story of Fanny Arguello's transition and struggle was documented in 2016 on this website, there she explains the need for an identity law and respect for the human rights of the trans population.

In Tuxtla Gutiérrez there is a sector of the population that lives part of their day in the shadows, between poorly constructed streets of the first square of the city and 18-centimeter heels; they give a degree of complexity. Transvestites, transsexuals, women and even men, meet in the streets of the center to exercise a trade with myths and discrimination such as: sex work.

One of the stories that would give an example of this would be "Fanny", who decided to make transformations in her body, to look beautiful as she once dreamed of being. Decision that was not made equally in her social circle, which led to social, economic and even family problems.

Born Alexis Arguello Romero, the first male child of a total of five siblings. in the Colonia Hidalgo of the municipality of Villa Comaltitlán, Chiapas, a family formed patriarchally by his father Addiel Arguello, who was a man who followed ancient stereotypes of the tasks that a man and woman had to perform.

> Fanny Argüello was one of the first LGBT activists I met. Hearing his story was my first approach to the Trans population, which in those years I still didn't understand.
>
> Sometimes it's not about the friendships you enter, she probably didn't know my name. But she moved a lot in me that day, and was inspiration to be more visible.
>
> Lots of light to the traveler.
