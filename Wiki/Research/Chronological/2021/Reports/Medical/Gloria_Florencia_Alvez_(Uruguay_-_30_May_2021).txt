>
> Gloria Álvez passed away on Sunday, May 30 at the age of 78. With more than 30 years of activism for the rights of transgender people and the LGBTI community, he left an indelible legacy for new generations: the creation of the Sex Work Law (17.515), the Right to Gender Identity Law (18,620) and, more recently, the Comprehensive Law for Trans Persons (19,684) . For her participation in the design of these laws, for her tireless activism for the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases and her battle against the sexual exploitation of girls, boys and adolescents, she was recognized nationally and internationally.
> 
> In 1990 Gloria founded the first trans collective in the country, whose name was the Transvestite Coordination Board, currently called the Uruguayan Trans Association (ATRU). She was its president and then its secretary. In recent years, she has also worked as the Uruguayan coordinator of the Latin American and Caribbean Network of Trans People (Redlactrans).
> 
> Gloria was a survivor. She went through the Children's Council in Salto, where she suffered abuse and mistreatment, was also confined in the Salto hospital and, during the dictatorship and post-dictatorship, resisted the confinement and torture imparted by police and military to trans people, called by they "passive pedophiles." In 1954, she served as a "guinea pig" for the doctors who applied the so-called "sexual conversion therapy", which consisted of giving electric shocks, recalled the Frente Amplio deputy Ana Olivera, who paid tribute to her in Parliament on Wednesday.
> 
> Karina Pankievich, president of ATRU, recalls that she met her 37 years ago, when both were engaged in sex work in Montevideo. They became friends and joined the military for the human rights of trans people. Pankievich remembers her as an intelligent, spontaneous woman, always concerned about the collective, “someone who took the world ahead” and who, despite the blows of life, always kept her sense of humor. He also remembered when Gloria broke into a conversation saying: "We are all women." "He had those things," he told the newspaper .
> 
> They were lifelong friends but, in recent years, Gloria became a mother to Pankievich, a mother who needed care for her cardiovascular problems. The president of ATRU treasures the memory of her talks in hotel rooms during her travels or when she gave her foot massages after a tiring day.
> 
> Gloria was an Umbandist and a devotee of the Orixá Mãe Oxum, deity of the Yoruba religion, who reigns in rivers, lagoons and springs and symbolizes femininity, beauty and love. Those on trips, I never forgot to buy sweet perfume for mãe , Which I Then at a small shrine Offered in His room, Pankievich said.
> 
> “To lose the memory of Gloria would be to lose the history of the trans movement. Gloria was in the first Diversity Marches, when they were held from the Obelisk to the University of the Republic, with the late Gloria Meneses and with so many who are not there today and others who are, like Karina Pankievich. If it weren't for Gloria and all those women who put her body on the street, we wouldn't be where we are today. Despite her lullabies, Gloria was always everywhere, ”Collette Spinetti, director of the Colectivo Trans del Uruguay (CTU), told the newspaper .
> 
> Spinetti's oldest memory of Álvez dates back to the first Diversity Marches: Gloria walking with a backpack loaded with condoms to distribute. Both Spinetti and Pankievich pointed to the insistence of the militant for the care and prevention of sexually transmitted diseases. She was especially concerned about the protection of the sex workers, who knew they could count on Gloria if they were ever short of prophylactics.
> 
> “A doctor from ASSE [State Health Services Administration] told me that the girls had to look for condoms in other health centers; He said 'this is not a kiosk'. And I said 'they are not going to any newsstand, they are going to my house. Many times I meet them in Bulevar Artigas. 'Do you know what it's like to be trans?' The girls use six to seven condoms per client, '”Gloria said during an interview we conducted with Jonathann Bentancor and Leticia Rizzo in 2018, which was published alongside others in the weekly Brecha .
> 
> That was the first time I saw her in person. It was in the ATRU office, located on Salto street, when we were doing our graduate work. When we arrived, Gloria stood up and said: "First I'm going to introduce myself." He gave his real name and the one his parents gave him, his identity card number and where he came from: Salto. She said it firmly, to emphasize that she was a citizen, but with a low voice, as if whispering, something that forced her to sharpen her ears and bring the recorder closer.
> 
> “Trans women are always alone. We are alone when we are born as trans, but more so when we die ”. Karina Pankievich, president of the Trans Association of Uruguay
> Gloria believed that number 8 was lucky because it is Oxum's number. That is why he was happy when he was notified that on the 8th of last month he was going to receive the first dose of the coronavirus vaccine. But it didn't come, Pankievich recalled. The last time they spoke, Gloria was in her room at Yaro and Maldonado's boarding house and, with a weak voice, she told him that she was feeling chills. She was admitted after being diagnosed with covid-19 and a few days later she died.
> 
> “Gloria's death also makes me think about the death of trans people. [...] Organizations should unite so that trans people have a dignified life, but also a dignified death. It is what we deserve ”. Collette Spinetti, director of the Colectivo Trans del Uruguay
> Like many families who have lost loved ones during the pandemic, Pankievich regrets not being able to say goodbye. “Trans women are always alone. We are alone when we are born as trans, but more so when we die ”, she said.
> 
> “Gloria's death also makes me think about the death of trans people. She always fought for life. The trans struggle is a struggle for life, for being. But we have to start thinking about trans death. Organizations should unite so that trans people have a dignified life, but also a dignified death. It is what we deserve ”, expressed, for his part, Spinetti. He gave as an example the experience of the Traves Chile collective, which in the face of this problem allocated funds to buy a cemetery where to bury its companions.
> 
> According to the census of trans people, carried out in 2016 by the Ministry of Social Development, life expectancy for this population in Uruguay is 35 years. Gloria is one of the few trans women who became old. Spinetti recalled that, while showing her collection of photos, Gloria always lamented: “They have all died. What a horrible thing.
