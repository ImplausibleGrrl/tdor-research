How Natali Sofía Martínez Grabados, 22 years old, a native of Santa Marta, was identified as the trans woman who died in a private clinic after undergoing cosmetic procedures, which she could not bear, on Thursday night in the city of Bogotá. 

According to the information provided by his relatives, the victim resided in the María Eugenia neighborhood, south of this capital, however, for work reasons, he had settled some time ago in the capital of the country. It was known that the woman had undergone different aesthetic procedures, of which she did not manage to get out as she wanted, as she suffered health complications that caused her death, presumably due to a cardiorespiratory arrest.

The body was taken to the morgue of Forensic Medicine in this area of the country, to undergo a rigorous autopsy to establish the true causes of death. His relatives traveled to the city of Bogotá to carry out the corresponding procedures in order to transfer the lifeless body to Santa Marta, where they will give him a Christian burial in the company of friends and family.
