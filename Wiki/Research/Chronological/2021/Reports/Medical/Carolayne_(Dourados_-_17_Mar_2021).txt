Transvestite is found dead in Dourados; police suspected overdose
17/03/2021 09h09 - By: Cristina Nunes

Police have just identified the victim found dead this morning (17) in the central region of Dourados. This is a transvestite who used the social name 'Carolayne', 49, who lives in Corumbá.

The victim's body was in front of a store on Hayel Bon Faker, on the stretch between Major Capilé and Weimar Torres. The Military Police were on site and also the technical expertise, commanded by the expert André Kiyoshi, to investigate the causes of death.

There were no apparent signs of violence in the body and the hypothesis is that the death was caused by an overdose, as a witness who spent the night with her reported that they both used drugs in the early hours.

The victim's body was taken to the IML, where tests will be carried out to confirm the cause of death.

The transvestite "Samper Line" (male name Waldomiro da Cunha Ferreira Filho), 49, was found dead on Wednesday morning (17) in the center of Dourados, 233 km from Campo Grande. Samper Line's body was next to a newsstand in the central construction site of Hayel Bon Faker, between Avenida Weimar Gonçalves Torres and Rua Major Capilé.

Another transvestite, a colleague of Samper Line, said that the two spent the night drinking and using drugs on the spot. Then they fell asleep. Earlier today, Samper Line's colleague woke up and realized that her friend was dead.

She said that the two had known each other since the time they were arrested at PED (State Penitentiary of Dourados). Samper Line would come from Corumbá. Military police and Civil Police experts were on the scene. The case was registered as a death to be clarified. The main suspicion is an overdose. ( Adilson Domingos collaborated)
