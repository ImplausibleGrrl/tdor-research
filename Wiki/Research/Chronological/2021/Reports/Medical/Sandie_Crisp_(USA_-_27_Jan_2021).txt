The transgender actress  Sandie Crisp , famous for the viral video "Obey the walrus", lost her life at 61 years of age, the singer Lana del Rey is one of the celebrities who dedicated a farewell message to her on her Instagram account.

"You meant everything to my sister and Hunter, that's why you meant a lot to me. Thank you for bringing so much joy to your lives," the singer wrote. 

Sandie, also known as "The Goddess Bunny," battled polio and HIV her entire life; Hunter, an actress very close to Sandie, requested, through the gofoundme platform, donations for Crisp's funeral services.

Johnnie Baima was born in the United States in 1960, from the age of two he came to different orphanages, from his childhood he began to experience the trauma of many: being sexually abused.

The California-born man suffered from polio and his body was severely affected by negligent treatment. The doctors who treated him implanted a steel bar that goes from the upper to the lower area of ??his spine in order to reinforce it; however it impaired his posture and stopped his growth.

This brought consequences, such as rejection and humiliation; and paradoxically they led him to the Hollywood underground scene where he found some comfort and admiration.

The Hollywood dream and the name change
In 1986 he worked as a model for the photographer Joel-Peter Witkin , doing artistic nudes for a play called "Leda" that took place in Los Angeles and was featured in major world exhibitions. That same year she acted for "Hollywood Vice Squad" as a secretary and three years later, after the filming of "The Goddness Bunny", she was linked to an ex-convict named Rocky who was released from prison. Not much was known about the relationship, but he ended it due to domestic abuse perpetrated by his partner.

In the 1980s, he confessed to homosexuality and married; however her husband died and she changed her name to Sandy Crisp to embrace her transsexual identity , becoming a trans and drag icon in California. From that moment he began working under the name The Goddess Bunny (The rabbit goddess).

This character has been very talented. He had a soft and melodic voice and, although he knows that much of his fame is due to his physical condition, he exploited it in his artistic works. Even in the original YouTube video where he appears dancing tap, you can see that there is nothing creepy.

"Obey the walrus" and boom in the Marylin Manson video
The archaic video for “Obedece a la morsa” (2007) shows a person with polio while tap dancing and holding an umbrella. It is a surreal scene recently seen, difficult to understand, but which generated great popularity in the 2000s.

Many theories indicated that it was a "subliminal video" to attract followers to a non-existent sect; Others thought that it was a "cursed video" that would have consequences if you stayed watching it all the time. Worse still, a group related "Obey the walrus" to the images of "The ring", as a woman who was going to pierce the screen and kill you. All wrong.

The Goddess Bunny featured gay / trans scenes in Los Angeles in 1994. From there, several images were obtained that were used for the controversial YouTube viral video titled "Obey the Walrus."

Nick Bougas was the creator of the 85-minute documentary released in 1998. The video was submitted by Johnnie Baima himself, of course, being recorded with his consent. The protagonist shows part of his life and in one of them there are scenes where he dances tap that, to be honest, is fun to watch, since it shows before, during and after the recording.

The cameraman obtained many scenes showing this natural and witty character dressed as a bride and holding an umbrella.

Later they usurped the original video, added the images of the beginning and the end and accompanied the shots with the music of "The little spider on a wall went up" in reverse, at a higher speed and changed in tone.

The images, viewed frame by frame, do not contain any strange images that seem remotely like a subliminal message. However, the edition of "Obey da walrus" had only one purpose: Publicity. And they got it.

Besides being offensive, it is an illegitimate appropriation of images, insinuating or presenting Johnnie Baima as if he was doing the editing, they invented an urban legend to line their pockets.

Given the popularity of the video, The Goddness Bunny appeared in the video "TheDope Show" by Marilyn Manson . In this epic footage, he can be seen frolicking and kissing the band members inside a limo.

"Obey the walrus" is an urban legend that continues to be spoken to this day and is part of the creepypasta world that abounds on the Internet. While they have been all the rage on YouTube, their story deserves to be redeemed and clarified.

> This morning, Sandie "the Goddess Bunny" Crisp died of COVID-19. She was like family to me. RIP Mom
> 
> Sandie lived a double life. She was the star of the first viral video, Marilyn Manson videos, and a Carrie Fisher movie, but she lived in a dirty assisted living facility and was bound to a wheelchair.
> 
> She suffered from HIV and Polio, and she was a disabled, trans little person long before Caitlyn Jenner.
> 
> Sandie lived a difficult life, but instead of complaining, she always lived life as if she was a movie star. Everyone says they don't give a fuck, but she TRULY didn't give a fuck.
