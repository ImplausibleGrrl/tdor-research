> Solidarity to the whole family, @bennybriolly and the other life companions of Lara Dieckman, Niterói's important transvestite leadership, who was the victim of Covid and the ongoing genocidal policy in the country. Lara was the creator of OLT, Trans and Travesti Fighting Organization, and her struggle helped countless women free themselves from homes and families that oppressed them for being who they are.
>
> Lara's steps will be followed and her legacy of fighting for the emancipation of trans and transvestite people inspires us to create another possible future. Lara, present!
