Anyky Lima, a militant for the rights of the trans population, died this Wednesday morning, 14, in Belo Horizonte, victim of bowel cancer, at the age of 65. A symbol of resistance, she was the third interviewee in the series “LGBT + 60: Bodies that Resist ”, and leaves an important legacy for young people in the fight against LGBTphobia. Grandma Anyky, as she was called by her friends, was known for her welcoming. He shared his small house in the mining capital with other LGBT + people who had nowhere to go. She was considered privileged for having passed 60 years of age, which represents almost twice the life expectancy of transsexuals in Brazil, which is only 35.

In a note, the ABLG (Brazilian Association of Lesbians, Gays, Bisexuals, Transvestites, Transsexuals and Intersexes) , lamented the loss: “Anyky illuminated all the events of the militancy, his tirades cuddled us and gave lightness to the toughness of facing LGBTIphobia , but he also knew how to score very well at the right moments and taught us with his long militant and life trajectory. A sex worker, he faced the dictatorship, the HIV / AIDS epidemic, accompanied several losses of murdered sisters and welcomed hundreds of us ”.

Through social networks, Antra (National Association of Transvestites and Transsexuals) also expressed itself : “A transvestite proud of herself, she left a legacy for the new generations and an example that the fight is worth. And that fighting is a vital need for the constitution of new ways of being and existing in a society so violent against our bodies ”.


She was only 12 years old when she was forced to leave the comfort of her home to face the reality of the streets. Since I was young, I cried everywhere that it was not a boy, but a girl. She wore lipstick, earrings and let her hair grow. For the parents, born in the interior of Pernambuco, Anyky's behavior was unacceptable.

Police officers took me out of the cell at dawn to have sex with me, while beating a black transvestite just for the pleasure

Anyky
Activist for the LGBT + community
Expelled from home, she slept for three days on the sidewalks of Rio. She managed to travel to Vitória, in Espírito Santo - where she stayed for eight years - and there she started her life as a call girl. Profession that would have until 50. Anyky fought and resisted the dictatorship. Trapped dozens of times, she said she just didn't get hit anymore because she was white. “Police officers took me out of the cell at dawn to have sex with me, while they beat a black transvestite just for the pleasure,” he recalls.

Having trouble sleeping due to body aches - the result of years of applying too many hormones - Anyky hardly ever leaves the house. He reported to #Colabora that he had night trauma. "If you are not afraid, you will not survive". To escape from depression, he cultivated a strong attachment to his pets and enjoyed spending time sewing.

About growing old by being trans, she lamented the lack of respect. “When you are over 40, you start to be called a maricona. We live on beauty. But as long as I breathe, I will continue to fight ”. And he continued.

In the documents, Anyky Gonçalves de Lima came into existence only at the age of 60, when he managed to rectify his birth name in the RG after months of bureaucracy. “Trans and transvestites have been militants since they came out. They fight when they go to the bakery, to the tavern. When they show their faces and occupy these spaces, they are militating ”.
