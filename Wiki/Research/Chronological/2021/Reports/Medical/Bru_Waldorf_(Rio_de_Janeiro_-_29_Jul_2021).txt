> TRANSFOBIA KILLS!
> 
> Bru Waldorf was from an evangelical and transphobic middle class family, who didn't respect the fact that she was a trans woman, they never supported her and even at the time of her death the parent doesn't respect her, with revolting Facebook post as if she didn't it was the female type.
> 
> She had already posted how oppressed she was by a family that never supported who she was, a total cowardice with her dignity. She couldn't even try to change her name and gender on her birth certificate and documents because her parents wouldn't accept it
> 
> She already posted showing desperation for finding a job that respected her social name, because it was a very oppressive family. They've already thrown it in the face that she was sustained but if they had supported the fact that they had a trans daughter and supported her in a professional career she could have a job and be independent
> 
> Apparently the place of his residence also operated an inn, business of the evangelical pastor progenitor, businessman and a cowardly and transphobic inhuman. With family business, it was a very dangerous environment for contamination.
> 
> She didn't just die of covid, she died from having to live trapped in an extremely hostile environment, cruel to extremely damaging transphobia, with no support to have a professional career without support of any nature without support becoming independent and the business of that transphobic They killed her. Lately she couldn't even go out once a month like before because of the pandemic and living in an environment like this, she had a very big psychological impact. But transphobic business has led the pandemic indoors.
> 
> The genocidal Jair who is also a disgusting transphobic and scoundrel should also be held responsible for not buying the vaccines as soon as he could.
> 
> The fundamentalist religion so called Christian, the religion of parents is also to blame for this because it has always fostered transphobia, criminal LGBTphobia and are one of those responsible for putting criminal genocidal in the presidency
> 
> Transphobia kills, transphobia burns people alive, leads people to depression, suicide, excludes from society, kicked out of the house. And when you don't kick out like Bru's case, you keep trans people being tortured in a terrible environment like what she lived through
> 
> I have no empathy with transphobic killers. These murderers transphobic scoundrels of her parents would die, but that she was alive and well. But most times bad vase doesn't break
> 
> Unlike these transphobic scoundrels, Bru, or Bruna, as she wanted, for me and for many friends and friends will be remembered as she really is, an amazing, amazing woman. I've cried a lot and the crying will be until when I die. You will forever be loved my dear friend
