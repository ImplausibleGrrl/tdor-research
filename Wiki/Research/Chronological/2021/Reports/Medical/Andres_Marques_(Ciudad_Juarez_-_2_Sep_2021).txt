> Ciudad Juárez— For almost seven months, Sandra Lorena Huiracocha has been searching from Ecuador for her trans son who disappeared on this border, and although last September 2 the authorities found a body with the same characteristics, no one has been able to confirm whether it is or not of him, so yesterday he publicly asked for help from his country. 
> 
> "Help me, they would like to put themselves in one's place, for so long and I have no answer," said the mother, who three months ago, through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ecuador, underwent a DNA test to verify if the body that remains in the Forensic Medical Service (Semefo) of Ciudad Juárez is that of Andrés Marqués, whose official name is Lizeth Yolanda Topón Huiracocha, 20 years old. 
> 
> According to the State Attorney General's Office (FGE) in the North Zone District, when the body of the man who died of a heart attack was found, the unit notified the Embassy of Ecuador in Mexico so that through them it could be officially identified and handed over to their relatives. 
> 
> However, what the South American authorities told her mother was that they had found a corpse of a Central American woman who looked like a man, with tattoos on her hands, and that they had to do a DNA test. But at her insistence, yesterday, three months later, they told her that they needed the DNA of more relatives, so her other two daughters and her brother-in-law, the brother of her deceased husband, had to go to the Ecuadorian Prosecutor's Office. 
> 
> The desperate mother contacted El Diario to ask for the support of someone who could help her speed up the procedures to find her son.
> 
> “They already have my DNA for three months, but they want that of the whole family; I already gave them all the characteristics of my daughter, that they see the tattoos on her hands (on one of a rose and on the other the initials 'LA'), I already want her body back, "claimed the Ecuadorian, who does not have the resources to travel to Ciudad Juárez to identify the body before the FGE. 
> 
> The discovery of the body took place at approximately 8:00 pm on Thursday, September 2, inside the motel converted into walls, located northeast of the city. The investigating authorities described her as between 20 and 25 years old, with short hair, wearing brown pants, green boxers and a green T-shirt. Later, they reported that the cause of her death was "infarction secondary to acute pulmonary edema, thromboembolism." 
> 
> Andrés, whose official name is Lizeth Yolanda, left Quito on August 24 for Panama, from where he traveled to Mexico City, and then to Juárez. El Diario sought out the Embassy of Ecuador in Monterrey, which until yesterday had not provided information on the support provided to the family.
