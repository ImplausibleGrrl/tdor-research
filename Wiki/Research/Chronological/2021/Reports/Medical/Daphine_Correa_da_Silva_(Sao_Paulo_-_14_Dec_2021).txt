The last farewell seems to be impossible for the family of Daphine Corrêa da Silva, 25 years old. The trans woman died at dawn this Tuesday (14), in São Paulo (SP), the city where she lived. If it wasn't enough to live with the pain of loss, family members still have to bear the anguish of perhaps not being able to watch over the body and pay the last tribute.
Daphine was born in Porto Velho, where she lived for more than half her life with family and friends.

According to the family, the young woman had an accident at the end of October and hit her head. According to preliminary information, Daphine was admitted to hospital and was diagnosed with severe pneumonia, which made the recovery process difficult.

The young woman then did not resist the advance of infections.
Now, Daphine's relatives who live in Porto Velho are asking for help to bring the body to the capital.

Her body is at the Forensic Medical Institute (IML) awaiting the release of the family to decide what will be done.

If the transfer of Daphine to the State is impossible, the girl will be buried in São Paulo.
