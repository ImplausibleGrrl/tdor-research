Bolivia's leading Trans People Network (Trebol) activist Rayza Torriani died this day due to complications from Covid-19. His friends indicated that his decessing is due to the lack of Intensive Therapy Units (ICU); she was admitted to a health center in Tiquipaya.

Arteaga regretted the fact and explained that Torriani was on a long waiting list to access an ICU. "On the night of Wednesday, May 19, I was able to sign a document saying that the health center where I was is not optimal and that it may die. She was on a long waiting list to be admitted to intensive care; The last time I spoke to her she told me that I was afraid to die, but not for her, but for her daughter," she wrote in a Facebook statement.

Torriani was a key figure for LGBTI causes in Bolivia. In 2006 she founded the Trebol Network, a network of trans women from Bolivia.
