DIE LORENA MUNIZ, ABANDONED TRANSEXUAL WOMAN SILED INCENCE IN A CLINICAL IN SP CENTER
Text: Helcio Beuclair (journalist)
Images of the internet.
Her name is Lorena Muniz, 25-year-old transgender woman, pernambucana and who was in São Paulo to realize a dream: to put silicone prosthetics and build the much-desired breasts.
This dream of Lorena is shared by several transvestites and transgender women who, because they are low-power people acquisitive and seduced by a true obscure coffee market, promise to make this dream come true with values well below the market price. These girls are subjected to surgeries, mostly underground and surrounded by a lot of risk, fear and insecurity.
According to a secure source that does not want to be identified for fear of retaliation, last Wednesday, 17/02/2021, Lorena Muniz and 04 other transvestites / transgender were at the ′′ Health Clinic Here ", which is located at the Street of Glory, no. 38, Neighborhood of Liberty, central São Paulo under the CEP: 01510-000.
According to this source, these girls were routed to this clinic by Paulino de Souza, who owns the Paulino de Souza LTDA Surgical Clinic, located rua Morocco, 31, Monte Alegre Park, Taboão da Serra / SP. It is important to inform the public that we found out in research that the CNPJ of Paulino de Souza already answers 08 cases, with 05 being from the São Paulo Court of Justice and 03 process from the Regional Court of work 2.
But these girls arrived at Paulino through Paty Carlos Ferreira, who collected the approximate values of R$ 4.250,00 of each of the transvestites / transgender women and delivered to Paulino de Souza, who in turn directed the girls to the Health Clinic Here , place of occurrence of facts
Returning to Lorena Muniz, we were narrated by a source that was at the site where she was at the surgery table (a stretcher without a mattress and straight in the metal frame) already sedated, when a surgical gear was turned on and the air conditioner of Health Clinic Here exploded. Immediately the officials, Paulino, who was present, and the 04 transvestites / transgender women left the clinic to the street, as video shows circulating on social media (link: http://bit.ly/IncendioClinicaSaudeAqui).
Transvestites / transgender women tried to get in to help Lorena but were impeached by officials. According to this source present on site, Lorena Muniz stayed about 25 minutes inside the burning clinic until the fire department arrived.
When learning about this situation with Lorena, her husband who lives in Recife / PE, Washington Barbosa, made a video (link: http://bit.ly/ApeloTOM) of appeal to be able to come to the city of São Paulo and follow the case. Arriving here, and supported by the teams of State Deputy Érica Malunguinho and Councilwoman Érika Hilton, he managed to gain access to the medical body that cared for Lorena. We at the Arouchianos collective will make ourselves available to help with foster care and with psychology.
The fact is that Lorena was rescued and taken to the Clinics Hospital without documents and was admitted as unknown, there she was revived, admitted to the ICU (intubated), and unfortunately she passed away on this day 21/02/2021, due to emphalic death due to absence of oxygen in the brain. We're looking for more information and soon less we'll bring everyone, everyone and everyone.
What we can advance is that we are organizing with the family, parliamentary mandates, the network of entities and activists so that this case does not go unpunished!
WHO HAS ANY DENOUNCEMENT INVOLVING THE CLINICS QUOTED ACIMA, GET IN CONTACT CONOSCO, LET'S KEEP YOUR IDENTITY IN SIGILO.
And we WANT JUSTICE May those responsible in this network that led to Lorraine's death be identified, prosecuted and receive the burden of the law on their shoulders. And the answers that need answers:
- THIS HEALTHY CLINIC HERE HAS AUTHORISATION TO REALIZE PLASTIC CIRURGIES?
- WHY WAS LORENA LEFT CLINIC DENTRE IN HALF TO THE START?
- WHY DIDN ' T LORENA DOCUMENTS BE TAKEN WITH HER TO THE HOSPITAL?
- WHY DID THE HEALTHY CLINIC HERE AND PAULINO TAKE TO 04 TRAVESTIS AND TRANSEXUAL WOMEN TO REGISTER B.O. IN DEFESS OF INVOLVED?
- WHO ARE THE REPONSIBLE FOR LORENA DEATH?
- AND EVEN WHEN TRAVESTS AND TRANSXUAL WOMEN WILL BE OUT OF SUS ASSISTANCE FOR THE TRANSXUALIZER PROCESS?

What a sadness ... Lorena Muniz, a transsexual woman from Recife, died in the early hours of this Sunday (21), who was left behind inside an aesthetic clinic that was on fire. At the time, she was under anesthesia to undergo breast implant surgery, so she was unable to react and save herself. Even so, employees abandoned her inside the establishment completely defenseless. Lorena inhaled smoke and was unconscious for seven minutes before being rescued, according to her husband, communicator Washington Barbosa.

The case occurred last Wednesday (17), in Taboão da Serra, São Paulo, after an electrical outage caused the fire early in the surgery. Lorena was rescued by the Fire Department and was admitted to the Hospital das Clínicas breathing with the help of devices, but unfortunately her brain death was decreed today. The information was confirmed by State Representative Erica Malunguinho (PSOL-SP) on Twitter. “She was a young transsexual woman, who was in São Paulo to make one of her biggest dreams come true. I don't have many words in the face of the atrocity that is the case that Lorena was subjected to ” , shared by the educator.

Still on Saturday (20), Washington Barbosa asked people to make a chain of prayers for his wife. The two lived in Pernambuco, and Lorena traveled to São Paulo with the aim of having the surgery with a doctor who, according to the communicator, was known for performing this type of procedure. Muniz had paid the first installment of the surgery in the amount of R $ 4,000, an amount that the company did not even return to the family.

Continues after Advertising
“Lorena and I had a life. Common, simple, even in the constant difficulties of racism and transphobia. We were married for 6 years. We met at a June party, São João night. Since we met, we are life partners ” , said Washington. The boy also explained that they were unable to afford tickets for two, so he was unable to accompany his beloved. Completely desolate, Washington recorded stories venting about his wife's death. “R $ 4 thousand reais. Lorena's life was worth R $ 4 thousand reais, my people ” , she said in tears.

In addition to Erica Malunguinho, city councilwoman Erika Hilton (PSOL) offered emotional and legal support to Lorena Muniz's family. “We must not measure efforts and outline a legal and political strategy for the clinic, located in Taboão da Serra, and its arms in other cities, to be investigated and held responsible, as well as the professionals responsible for the procedures. It is indignant, but we cannot allow the spectacularization of death due to medical negligence and allow what happened with one more transvestite to go unpunished. If we don't press, that's what will happen, ” he wrote in a press release.

Continues after Advertising
“I was deeply touched by everything that happened. Many trans and transvestite girls are victims of clinics that perform surgical procedures that do not guarantee the safety and quality of procedures. It is a reality in Brazil. Unqualified professionals, inadequate environments. It is a fact that it can also harm people who are not trans. It is essential that the competent bodies inspect these places. Contrary to what they think, this is not an aesthetic process, but part of the struggle of trans and transvestites to find themselves in the body of their identities ”, published Erica Malunguinho.
