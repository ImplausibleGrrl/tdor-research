Influencer Ygona Moura died last night , aged 23, after spending days in hospital for complications caused by covid-19. His body was buried today , at 11 am, in the cemetery of Vila Formosa, in the East Zone of S達o Paulo.

Ygona went viral on social media for sharing funny videos and also making fun of the agglomerations he participated in during the pandemic, but his story is much more tragic than it looks.

Pandemic challenges
Assuming he was gay at 16, Ygona reported that she had difficulty finding a job because she was black and fat. In addition, he lived on a war footing with his mother, who did not accept her.

"At home, my mother says she accepts my sexual option, but she has even denied me a plate of food just because I was out of work," recalled Ygona, in an interview with National Geographic in December.

At 20, she discovered she was trans and ended up looking for prostitution. "I got my first wig, got on and never stopped. It was a way to learn and appreciate myself too, I never believed it would attract the attention of men", he says, in the same interview.

Shortly before the start of the pandemic, he had found a formal job, and reestablished his link with his family. But with the spread of the virus, she was fired and said that she suffered again at the hands of relatives. Until a situation caused her to be kicked out of her home in November last year.

Expulsion and assassination attempt
With no job or perspective, Ygona became known for the funny videos she shared on Instagram. In November last year, however, the crisis peaked when she was kicked out of the home after an argument with her brother who, she said, tried to kill her for not accepting her as a trans.

Today Ygona, a trans influencer, suffered a transphobia attack where she was almost murdered by her own brother. Help her with positive messages on Instagram (@ / ygona.moura), share about the case and financially (she is away from home).

You almost lost me. I almost died, I was going to be murdered by my brother who doesn't accept me, he's jealous of me. My mother called the police and forced me to leave the house, I who was the victim. I don't know what to do, if I throw everything up, if I throw myself off the bridge. It makes me want to kill myself. If I had a gun now, I would shoot myself. I didn't have to go through that humiliation. I wanted to have the courage that my father had. He killed himself by hanging.

Fame on Instagram
Thanks to the outburst, Ygona managed to attract attention on social networks, where a kitty was organized to raise money to help her outside the home. She then moved to a foster home for trans and transvestite women, where she still lived, before being admitted.

"All the messages I received motivated me to follow. I felt that I have a future with the internet and that motivated me a lot to not give up on my life. I want to be an influencer," he said in an interview with National Geographic.

With the recognition on the internet, Ygona surpassed the mark of 100 thousand followers and started to be called for events and trips, in addition to promoting some products and brands on Instagram. It was during this period, always attending several parties, that the videos making fun of the agglomerations appeared and spread.

Guys, what a night it was ... a night of successful agglomeration, I agglomerated myself. Oh! And I received well for that, see ?!

Guys, what night was that? Night of successful agglomeration! I left the party almost 8 in the morning. I really crowded! And I received well for that. Kisses to the bad tongues!

Long before being infected and dying, Ygona always denied supposed news about her death. In a live with actor Igor Cosso in November, she told just about when they invented that she had contracted the covid-19 and died.

This video is unbelievable. She talking to me who invented that she took Covid and died. Just what happened. pic.twitter.com/pYIdAKP3Td

Without even knowing it, the news of his hospitalization traveled the world, being shown in newspapers in Europe and Latin America. The tragic end marks a story that had just begun.
