Rome, bullying at school: 13-year-old gender questioning commits suicide
By Davide Dummy / 18 June 2021

On 6 June a 13-year-old gender questioning was found lifeless by her mother, who for months had already reported to the school that her children were being bullied because of her gender identity. In fact, Noah (invented name) did not seem to live serenely the changes in his body during adolescence, so he decided to cut his hair and use a neutral name.

The mother and her lawyer, who talk about their children using pronouns of the gender assigned at birth, are in fact convinced that the anxiety and depression that had been diagnosed in Noah were the result of the treatment reserved by the friends who, from the moment of the first of awareness of his own gender identity, they had isolated him and called him [deadname]. It was no use to change class: according to what was declared by the mother, in the last few days they had rebuked themselves with acts of bullying.

Yet, in an email sent to the head teacher last November, the woman had expressed her concern. "Unfortunately, even after the class change, the same problems continue to exist - he wrote - my daughter was targeted by a small group of girls mainly for her physicality, object of derision and chatter that seems to have spread to other classes as well. . […] My daughter is starting to take it out on herself. […] We need your attention and your help, I can't do it alone ”.

According to what reported by the Messenger , the principal nevertheless believes that everything possible has been done, arguing that Noah "was happy at school" and, about gender identity, that "a principal is the last to know". «The experts - says the lawyer of the young man's mother - are clear in affirming that the evaluation that Noah made of himself was based on what others thought of her. So let's imagine how much certain statements and certain jokes may have influenced. If there have been responsibilities in omissions or underestimations they must be identified ».

A story not to be ignored in the debate on the Zan bill
There are two aspects on which Noah's death should make us reflect and they are precisely the two points on which the right and the "gender critical" minority current of feminists are leveraging to prevent the approval of the bill against homotransphobia.

The article most opposed by Lega, Fratelli d'Italia and part of Forza Italia is the one on the national day against homo-lesbo-bi-transphobia , which encourages (but does not oblige) schools to carry out activities to educate to respect of homosexual, bisexual and transgender people. There are, on the right, those who have called it "state pedophilia" and an "imposition of homosexuality" , and those who have stirred up the usual bugbear of gender, without being able to explain what it is .

The main "concern" of the detractors of the Zan bill is that in order to talk about homophobia or transphobia it is necessary to explain to elementary and middle school children what sex is. This is a wholly specious fear, since one can speak of same-sex attraction in terms of affectivity, while gender identity is an issue that has no direct relationship with sexual relations.

Then there is the will of the adherents of the gender critical movement, as well as the usual right and some centrists , to replace, within the text of the law, the expression gender identity with "transsexuality", or to completely remove , as can be seen from the counter-proposal of the Ronzulli bill . This might seem harmless to many, but it would increase the risk that the law will not be applied to cases of discrimination against transgender people who have not started or who choose not to start a medicalized transition path , of non-binary people , gender questioning and gender variant, or those who in Italy are most exposed to discrimination and violence .
