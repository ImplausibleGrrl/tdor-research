> My lover, my sister, my "sisterhood", my "afterlife", my fateful friend, my sister, my love... Summit, my Portobello Witch. You came into my life and touched me in my thinnest parts in a short time. Everyone wondered how two trans women could be lovers. You made me cry, you laughed, you left,

> If you lived; Maybe because you were afraid of the dark, maybe we would have set this city on fire with our anger, now I want to flood all the streets of Istanbul with our tears. I love you so much, Zip. Thanks for everything. Your little one will never forget you.
