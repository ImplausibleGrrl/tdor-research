JAMSHEDPUR: Aliya, a 33-year-old transgender, who begged at traffic signals in the Steel City, committed suicide on Sunday, while her fellow mates claimed she took the extreme step after not being able to make ends meet amid the lockdown. Aliya was a resident of Burmamines area.

Muskan, another eunuch living in the same area, said after the partial lockdown came into force, they were not allowed to visit any home fearing the spread of Covid-19 virus. Members of the eunuch community also visit houses after couples have babies to seek money.

She said, “Unable to bear the financial burden, Aliya committed suicide.”

Muskan pointed out that a few days back, a large section of eunuchs had marched to the deputy commissioner’s office and handed over a memorandum demanding compensation from the state government as they had lost their source of income.

Muskan reminded that last year dry ration was distributed to all and this should be done this year too.
