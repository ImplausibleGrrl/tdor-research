According to the first tests, she had been in the water for about 5 days, so her body was unrecognizable. The data in the case are not many, in principle they are oriented to the hypothesis of a suicide, but her family and friends ask that the investigation be continued and they suspect that it could be a homicide.

"They are trying to find the last people she was with," said Franco Chacón, Josefina's friend, who added that "we have received information that could have been a settling of accounts, from an older man who harassed her for a long time and even trafficking . There are many things that cause us confusion. All we want is for this to be clarified. "

THE FRIENDS MADE AN ALTAR TO REMEMBER HER.
Josefina lived in Godoy Cruz, last year she worked as a therapeutic assistant and practiced prostitution. Her relatives described her as "a girl with a cheerful, happy soul and capable of lifting your spirits at all times. A woman full of happiness, but she did not show if she was bad or sad, it was difficult to help her. 

This Saturday his friends carried out a peaceful march from kilometer 0 to San Luis and Ituzaingó asking for Justice. On Wednesday they will have a mass to see her off.

" We seek and ask for justice for the doubtful death of Josefina , as well as that of Melody -the young transvestite murdered in the Access-. We have to know what happened to them so that they can rest in peace. Today Josefina left and we want Justice present "Franco concluded.
