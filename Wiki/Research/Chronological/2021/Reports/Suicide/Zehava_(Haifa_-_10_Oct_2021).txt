> After trying to end her life, Zahava lay in the hospital for almost an entire week without any of her relatives knowing where she had gone. The medical staff tried in vain to find out her identity, the associations that helped her were unable to find out what happened to her and she eventually passed away alone. The tragic death of the transgender Palestinian who was in Israel has reopened the Palestinian Pandora's box and Israel's helplessness in caring for them

> Zehava lay asleep and breathing at Rambam Hospital for almost a whole week, after trying to end her life, without any of her friends, family members or aid organizations who helped her over the years knowing about it. After five days in the hospital alone, doctors had to disconnect her from the resuscitation equipment and determine her death. She was only 22 years old. 
> 
> During the days she was hospitalized, the Elam organization, the Gila project and the Association for the LGBT people, tried to find out what happened to the transgender Palestinian she had helped, since she disappeared on Friday, October 8, but they did not succeed. To this day, the full picture from the moment it disappeared until it was buried has not yet been clarified, and it is doubtful whether it will ever be fully clarified, but in recent days more details have been revealed, which may shed light on the various circumstances that led to the tragic outcome.
> 
> The medical staff who treated Zahava almost gave up trying to find out who the young woman was, a few days after she arrived at the emergency room. "Whenever Palestinian missing people come to us, I get a hundred thousand phone calls and messages," Yazid Falah, a health coordinator at Rambam Hospital for Patients from the Palestinian Authority, told Mako. "Look for the person and we did not find any information."
> 
> According to him, they contacted the Israel Police Hospital, which helped locate the phone number from which Zehava called on the day she ended her life, from the public park in Haifa where she was located, a number of streets near the hostel where she was staying. Unfortunately, even this individual did not have time for a reliable identification of the anonymous person, because the approval of one of her family members was required, whom they were unable to locate. The medical staff contacted the health coordinator at the Beit El Civil Administration headquarters, asking for help locating her family, but Fallah said, "We gave them all the details and nothing was done. There were no calls from either the military or anyone from the family. It was already an exception."
> 
> It was only on Thursday, almost a week after she was found, that a Palestinian officer first contacted the hospital and said that Zehava's father was with him. Two hours later, he entered Israel, talked to the medical staff and went to identify the body. The father said he was in daily contact with his daughter, but continued to treat her in male language and without mentioning that she fled the PA because she experienced sexual violence and severe threats from the family. Police confirmed that it was a suicide case, and the hospital contacted the Civil Administration to confirm the transfer of the body.
> 
> Meanwhile, her friends, the staffs of the aid organizations and everyone close to her, continued to wonder what happened to her and looked for her. Elam told us that a few days after she disappeared, a complaint was filed with the police about her absence, but no relevant information came up. On the other hand, the police claim that no report of a missing person was received. 
> 
> Only last Friday, after her sister announced the funeral that took place in the West Bank, did her friends, relatives and aid organizations realize the magnitude of the disaster. Naama's grandmother, director of the status department at the Association for the LGBT, who assisted Zehava, says that she applied independently for assistance. She believes that if it was a Jew and not a statusless transgender woman, the conduct would have been completely different.
> 
> "This story proves what we keep saying - there are not enough answers," she said in a conversation with Mako. "Honestly, it's just surprising that there are no more such cases. If we had known from the beginning that this was her, at least we could have said goodbye to her and let her soul come out with this connection. She was important to a lot of people. I do not know if we could have prevented the case, but here A great responsibility of society and the state. "
> 
> Following the incident, various organizations decided to band together to promote solutions for women engaged in prostitution and statusless Palestinians, among other things, by promoting awareness of the issue in the media, on the social network and in the Knesset. In addition to the ceremony held in memory Saturday Meir Park in Tel Aviv, met on Sunday the campaign against trafficking in women, "not just stand aside - helping women out of prostitution", "different home LGBT Arab community empowerment" and other organizations to take care of the case that , where a woman A transgender woman in distress is left alone, she will also be the last.At the same time, MK Michal Rosin (Meretz) submitted a request for a quick discussion on the issue of "the situation of thousands of people in Israel who are in the circle of prostitution."
> 
> The story of Zehava's life is shaky and chilling . She is a transgender woman born in the Occupied Territories and subjected to severe sexual violence and serious threats from her family, until she first fled to Israel at the age of 15. Since then, she has been caught and arrested, deported back and forth again and again, while being persecuted Many LGBT people who are forced to flee the PA and survive in difficult conditions in Israel.
> 
> During her stay in Israel, Zehava moved between a number of welfare frameworks, including the "pink roof" operated by the Signals Association, and in recent months she has been in the frameworks operated by the Elam Association. One of the social workers who cared for her said she was trying to rebuild her life and find the right path. So, as soon as she heard that she was missing, she was very worried for her life. "It was not typical for her to disappear," she told Mako in a private conversation. "She always made contact and if it was difficult for her she asked for help. It was her strength, to know how to recruit people from around her to help her. We even had a WhatsApp group of lots of professionals whose whole purpose was to help only her." 
> 
> In the period before her death, Zehava moved from the "Alma" project of the Elam organization, intended for girls and young women, to another framework, which was gender mixed, in Haifa. It turns out that the trust body for the placement in the Ministry of Welfare saw her as "too masculine for a frame for women only." According to various factors in Zehava's environment, the transition had a severe effect on her mental state. The hospital said she arrived at the emergency room in early October and asked to be hospitalized claiming she was suffering from mental health issues, but after being admitted to the emergency room, she left the hospital without receiving treatment.
> 
> Recently, Zehava felt she was ready to tell her story in her voice in front of the cameras and she was photographed for a film by an unpublished Israeli director, which deals with the transgender Palestinian community. "I'm in favor of taking the story out to provoke change, but photography could have hurt her, so I advised her not to be photographed," says his grandmother. "I could not know who would see the film and I made it clear to her that her life is first and foremost."
> 
> Like other statusless Palestinians from the gay community , the association tried to help it obtain a work permit and even found an employer in Tel Aviv who was willing to deal with the bureaucracy. Despite this, they did not receive a reply on the matter from the Civil Administration, the trust for the issuance of work permits. "The fact that they are given a residence permit without a permit to live is like a roller coaster for them, which only miraculously many of them do manage to survive," his grandmother shares.
> 
> It is likely that the unfortunate case of Zehava could have been prevented if only she and the Palestinians of other stateless people had been allowed to properly rehabilitate in the State of Israel. , The associations that help this underprivileged population and not.Women in prostitution, are very limited to lack any ability to help women and people who really need it.
> 
> About three months ago, the "different house" together with a number of LGBT hostels and the Association for LGBT people approached Health Minister Nitzan Horowitz, demanding that medical insurance be provided to Palestinian LGBT asylum seekers, but have not yet been answered. Tikva in a High Court hearing to be held in a few weeks, which may decide on a petition filed by attorney Adi Lustigman three years ago, which seeks to allow medical insurance and social rights for Palestinians without status in Israel.
> 
> The Ministry of Welfare and Social Security stated:"We express our deep sorrow over Zehava's death and send our sincere condolences to her dear. The Ministry of Welfare and Social Security is doing everything in its power to provide a humanitarian and tailored response to all applicants seeking assistance from the state, even when applicants have not yet been settled." Placement of frameworks operated by the Ministry of the LGBT Community and staying in three of them. The social difficulty faced by the transgender community is complex and challenging, and the welfare services of the State of Israel are doing everything in their power to reach out and help this population. Only recently has the ministry opened a large number of frameworks designed to provide an appropriate social response to community members who are in difficulty, and will soon open a new emergency shelter and 8 transitional apartments intended for the trans community, along with professional training and social guidance. The doors of all the frameworks are also open to applicants whose status in Israel has not yet been settled, but unfortunately, the placement in these frameworks also failed to prevent Zehava's tragic death.

> What a Transgender Woman's Death Reveals About Palestinian LGBTQ Community in Israel
> Zehava fled the West Bank to escape abuse and prostitution. But in Israel, she was left without basic rights – even welfare institutions offered no solution. ‘They said her appearance was not feminine enough'
> 
> Oct. 19, 2021
> Zehava’s body was found by police in a public park in Haifa on Friday, October 8. The 22-year-old transgender woman was found hanging, in grave condition, and was rushed to the hospital. She died two days later. The police believe she committed suicide.
> 
> Zehava’s life and tragic death have turned a spotlight on the hard lives of members of the LGBTQ+ community who lack permanent residency status in Israel. Life as a transgender woman in Israel is full of difficulties in any case, and there is a shortage of frameworks where members of the community can find support. But for those who lack residency status, life is nearly impossible, given the lack basic rights such as work permits, health insurance or the ability to open a bank account. All of these concerns, compounded by the fear that her residency status would not be renewed, brought Zehava to the edge of the abyss, welfare activists say.
> 
> “The state of Palestinian LGBTQ+ asylum seekers is shocking,” says Nina Halevy, an activist in the Gila project for transgender empowerment in Israel, who was working with Zehava. “The state allows them to stay here grudgingly and under impossible conditions, but they have no way to live. They’re allowed to be in the country, but they have no rights. What can they do? How can they survive? It’s the government that pushes them into prostitution. They deliberately provide insufficient aid.”
> 
> Zehava was already living in the street as a child. As a teenager she was sexually abused and exploited several times. A field worker who aided her recounted that Zehava had been forced into prostitution at a young age and had been blackmailed and threatened when she tried to object. In 2018, when she was 19-years-old, Zehava fled from a Palestinian city to Israel, and asked to be recognized as a victim of human trafficking. She was arrested several times for illegal residency and indicted four times. She was deported back to the Palestinian Authority, returned to Israel and was arrested again. A social worker attempted to get her a residency permit given her at-risk status as a member of the LGBTQ+ community.
> 
> “I want a permit to work in Israel. I’ve asked everyone, the police, the court – three times – but no one will help me,” Zehava said in court in January 2020, after being charged with living in Israel illegally. “I can’t go back to the [Palestinian] territories. If I go to prison, I’ll stay there for several months. When I’m released I’ll go back. I want to enter Israel. Nobody can give me a permit, everyone says they can’t help me, so who can help?” Her plea went unheeded, and the court sentenced her to three months in prison.
> 
> Several months ago, The Aguda – The association for LGBTQ Equality in Israel, requested a residency permit for Zehava from the welfare coordinator in the Civil Administration, arguing that she was under threat in the Palestinian territories. The welfare coordinator met with Zehava, and she received a residency permit for welfare reasons, which was valid until the end of October.
> 
> “Everytime the renewal date on her residency permit approached, Zehava would become very distressed – depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts. She would drink to oblivion for days straight just to numb the anxiety,” Halevy said.
> 
> If the fear of expulsion wasn’t enough, like other Palestinians living in Israel for humanitarian reasons, Zehava did not receive a permit to work legally in Israel. In August The Aguda turned to the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories, Ghassan Alian, and noted that Zehava had requested a work permit back in May, but received no reply. Alian did not respond to a request for comment.
> 
> Halevy met Zehava in January 2021 while she was staying in Gag Havarod – an emergency Welfare Ministry shelter for young LGBTQ+ people. She stayed there for about four months, the maximum permitted time. “It’s a particularly cruel ticking clock for the Palestinian young people,” says Halevy. “It’s impossible to complete any rehabilitation process in just four months.”
> 
> On the brink of being thrown out into the street, Zehava was given a hotel room for two months as a donation through the Tel Aviv LGBT Center. “She stayed there without work, without money for food, cigarettes or clothes. She was frustrated and very alone,” says Halevy.
> 
> Zehava was living without health insurance or a work permit and at this point no framework could take her in. Fearing that she would end up in the street, Halevy sent her to Alma, a framework for at-risk girls and young women operated by the Elem NGO.
> 
> While Halevy says that the staff and young women welcomed Zehava, she was soon removed from the program. The welfare supervisor refused to allow Zehava to stay because “her appearance is not that of a woman.”
> 
> “That broke Zehava. She thought she had found a home, and a few days later she was told – pack up, you’re moving,” said Halevy. “Now that Zehava is no longer with us, we must go to war – excluding transgender women from female spaces? Pushing them into ghettos? It can’t happen. We deserve social services like the general population.”
> 
> Around the same time, the Coalition Against Prostitution sent a letter to Welfare Ministry officials about Zehava’s situation and those of other transgender women. “In a situation where the aid organization cannot provide a solution or transgender women, we are all, the government and civil society, likely to be responsible for abandoning an entire population.”
> 
> Zehava moved to Haifa to Elem’s Halev complex. People who were there said she was well received, but found it difficult to fit in and sometimes preferred to sleep in the street. For a while she slept in a public park in Jaffa, and one night she was raped. “We bought food for her, got a donation for a hostel for one night. She tried with all her might not to end up in prostitution,” says Halevy. In the end she returned to Halev in Haifa.
> 
> A worker in an anti-prostitution organization said that about two weeks before her death Zehava’s behavior changed, and she asked to be addressed with masculine pronouns. Halevy says it was a survival choice: “Anything that helps keep you alive is part of the toolbox, there’s no judgement. Staying alive is the supreme goal. You can win some other day, but when the conditions and circumstances are uncomfortable, you have to know when to give in.”
> 
> People who knew Zehava said that her condition seemed to be improving in the week before her suicide. She had found a job and her employers were willing to hire her without a permit. Sadly, she still chose to end her life.
> 
> Attorney Meirav Ben Zeev of HIAS, an organization that helps asylum seekers, represented Zehava in her request to be recognized as a victim of trafficking: “Zehava’s tragedy, who came to Israel hurt and in search of a safe place, is deeply frustrating and painful. When someone flees here in desperate need of hope, seeking a light at the end of a very long, dark tunnel, it is our responsibility, as human beings and as a state, to help them.”
> 
> “Although there is considerable awareness of the desperate need for rehabilitation and treatment, the necessary help isn’t forthcoming. Zehava’s case illustrates the result of that absence. The shelter system is closed to Palestinian LGBTQs and women. They depend on a ‘welfare’ permit from the Civil Administration that provides no welfare, doesn’t grant them social and medical rights or the right to work or survive,” Ben Zeev said. “Most wait months and years for the state’s help, while depending on aid organizations that also find it difficult to carry out their job due to the nature of the permit.”
> 
> In July the High Court of Justice asked the state to explain why it refuses to give temporary work permits to Palestinians who fled to Israel because of their sexual orientation. The State Prosecutor’s representative, attorney Moriah Frieman, said that Palestinians with a residence permit for welfare reasons can request for an individual work permit, and that 14 people have received such permits.
> 
> But Justice Daphne Barak-Erez rejected the claim, explaining that an individual permit requires a request from the employer, and sometimes it takes a long time to find one. “What should they do? Steal? Sell their bodies?” asked the judge.
> 
> The Welfare Ministry said in response to this article, “We are deeply sorry about Zehava’s death and send our sincere condolences. The ministry does everything possible to provide a humanitarian solution to everyone requesting help from the government, even those whose status is not yet arranged. The deceased was placed in frameworks for LGBTQ+ people and stayed in three of them.”
> 
> The ministry wrote that they are doing whatever they can to help the LGBTQ+ community, whose social problems are complex and challenging, including opening several new frameworks, even for those without residency status, but unfortunately these services couldn’t prevent Zehava’s tragic death. They wrote that the complaints about the circumstances of moving her between different frameworks will be examined by the ministry.

> Our granddaughter writes: 
> Zehava is gone,
> Gone a few days ago, phones and messages started running around in the small group of activities that surrounded her, and tried, with terrible awkwardness, to accompany and assist her in her difficult way over the past year
> In her short life, Zehava managed to experience infinite difficulty: a poor and dysfunctional family, violence, abuse and street life, numerous attempts to escape and find refuge on the so-called enlightened side of the wall, which repeatedly ended in Abu Kabir arrest and deportation back to her trauma districts in Tulkarm.
> Confirmation that was? Hardly achieved, and before any recurrence depression, anxiety, alcohol and suicide
> Shelter? At times, with great difficulty, with a lot of despair on the way (well-being? Your transphobia screams to heaven, most of all, a sham on your part)
> Medical rights? No
> Work permit? No way?
> Did not give up, fought. In our last conversation, optimistic, found a job in the black, earns some money, maybe she will save and rent an apartment - but not really, she is also not allowed to open a bank account ...
> Despite all this, Zehava was a rare flower: a very special young woman, open-eyed and dreamy, sensitive, curious, undecided, wondering about life and its meaning, wanted to study psychology, philosophy, religions and spirituality, find meaning and do good in the world. She was proud and noble-minded, and smart enough to experience in full force the understanding that the world simply does not want her, and does not assign her any place under the sun
> How awful that she was eventually broken, and in order to stifle the pain and despair that filled her, she turned towards her body is the violence that the world directed at her - 
> How terrible, how sad, how angry and frustrating !!!!
> We can never be defeated,
> Let there be a remembrance of a revolution.





> Zahava, a Palestinian transgender who escaped from Tul Kerem to Israel after being beaten by murder from her family put an end to her life.
> Zahava I met in the emergency Helenat in the pink roof, her only request to get a stay and work in Israel until she gets stronger and from here to seek asylum abroad. She wanted to rest from the persecution due to her sexual and national identity. Unfortunately she didn't find rest neither here nor there.
