Ella died by suicide in front of a department store on Alexanderplatz. She was an Iranian refugee who had been living in Germany for several years.

> BERLIN taz | Although around 200 people are standing in front of a department store on lively Alexanderplatz, there is complete silence. It is the mourning rally for Ella, as they all call here, a transsexual woman from Iran who burned herself in public on this spot last Tuesday. Little by little people emerge from the crowd and put flowers and candles down. Many people cry, some softly, some loudly. A photo, a small cross and the blue-pink-white Pride flag of transgender people were also placed here.
> 
> The 40-year-old died in hospital on Wednesday. An employee of the department store had extinguished the burning woman with a fire extinguisher and a helicopter had taken her to the hospital. According to the police, it is not known why she took her own life. For everyone present, however, it is clear that it was the daily discrimination that drove them to suicide.
> 
> “I don't want to give a political speech,” says the organizer at the beginning. Like almost everyone here, she also found out about the suicide on Twitter. "But it's also clear that Ella left a political mandate," she continues. It is good to mourn together and to meet each other with appreciation.

> Berlin Alexanderplatz. Ella, who fled Iran, committed suicide here on September 14th. A memorial has now been set up here. A large heart made of withered flowers lies on the floor, candles are burning, notes with messages are stuck to the shop window. Many, especially young people, remain moved. A few meters away, a father and son are playing street music.
> 
> Why Ella set herself on fire with suicidal intent a good three weeks ago, even people who knew her have no definite answer. "I think Germany did not meet the expectations that they had," suspects Dagmar. "Berlin pretends to be a free city - you are sexually and psychologically harassed on every corner." Ella also experienced that.
> 
> The two women knew each other through Dagmar's work. For 20 years she has been a volunteer medical contact person for trans people, including refugees. Ella was introduced to her by her therapist, like many others before. 
> 
> "I couldn't live as a trans woman in Iran"
> Ella's suicide came as a surprise to those around them. "Otherwise we would have held her, it's clear," says Dagmar. Not even her best friend suspected anything. And Dagmar himself wasn't in Berlin that day. "Ella knew that too, maybe that's why this day."

> Ella, how they remember their friends.
> 
> There seems to be a suicide note from Ella, but the probate court hasn't released it yet. First her family has to be located in Iran - a complex situation. "We hope that her family is not interested in her," says Dagmar. Because Ella fled from Iran to Germany for a reason. “We would like to bury her ourselves, in our own way, just as she would have liked,” says Dagmar.  
> 
> Like so many refugees, Ella assumed that she was welcome in Germany. She hoped for another life. In a video portrait of Ella from the Offenen Kanal Magdeburg from 2019, she says: “I had a good apartment in my home town, also work, a good salary. But I couldn't live in Iran as a trans woman. "
> 
> In Iran, homosexuality is punishable by death. As a trans woman, Ella could theoretically have lived there, but she would always have been denied social recognition. The great desire to simply be a woman was also denied her by various German training institutions. "The first place that gave her a diploma with the correct name and gender, Ella and wife, was TÜV in Berlin," says Dagmar. And she adds that Ella dreamed of working at Tesla.
> 
> Locked up in the men's prison
> Jamila also came to Berlin's Alexanderplatz to commemorate Ella. Jamila is a trans woman with Ethiopian citizenship, like Ella in her early 40s. She was born and raised in Qatar, where she had to go to a psychiatric hospital and was imprisoned just because of her transsexuality. She was eventually deported to Ethiopia, where she was imprisoned again - she says.
> 
> Jamila's case also preoccupies Juliana. On her Twitter account “Unruly July” she negotiates political trans issues. Jamila told her what she went through. “She was in a cell with 28 men in the men's prison,” says Juliana. There, sexualized violence was done to her. "Then photos were taken of her, which could be seen on Ethiopian television." Jamila and her body were shown, "exhibited like an animal."
> 
> To escape this nightmare, Jamila fled from Ethiopia to Germany. The first notification from the BAMF, the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees, was negative, however, and the reason was hair-raising: Jamila was clearly recognizable as a woman, as desired, and so she could not be in danger.

> 
> Juliana sees it differently. Should Jamila be deported to Ethiopia, she is in danger of every passport check. "Because she is a woman, but the ID has a male name and there is an old photo on it so that she could be arrested again under the pretext that she had a false identity." Jamila could be in a male prison again land.
> 
> "I'm so tired, I'm so sick of it"
> Deshalb gab es Mitte August eine Demonstration und eine Social-Media-Kampagne unter dem Hashtag #Jamilableibt. Das BAMF hat eine erneute Prüfung zugesichert, aber das Ergebnis steht noch aus. Eine zermürbende Situation für Jamila: „Ich weiß nicht, was im BAMF los ist, ich warte immer noch“, erzählt sie. Und dann werden ihre Worte so eindringlich, dass es kaum auszuhalten ist. „Ich bin so müde, ich habe es so satt. Falls sie mich wirklich wieder nach Äthiopien abschieben wollen, mache ich meinem Leben lieber ein Ende.“
> 
> Juliana, who makes the concerns of trans people heard on Twitter, cannot believe that Jamila's asylum application has been rejected - especially now, after Ella's suicide while she was supposed to be free. “This decision by the BAMF cannot be justified,” she criticizes. "The authority has probably relied on it that it will not get into the public eye and that the current political climate is such that it is just allowed to get away with."
> 
> If you know people who are desperate like Ella and Juliana, or if you have thoughts of suicide yourself, you can contact the telephone counseling anonymously and at any time , the number is: 0800 111 0 111.
