Karol was found dead inside her home in Rio Branco, Acre (Brazil) on 8 Oct 2021.


Transsexual Karol Souza was found dead last Friday (8) inside her house, in Rio Branco. Due to the way her body looked, both the police and family and friends believe she took her own life. She had been showing signs of depression.

Karol's body was taken to the Forensic Medical Institute (IML) and after carrying out the necessary procedures, it was released for funeral and burial. The official report pointing to the cause of death must be ready within 30 days.

On social networks, friends paid tribute to the trans. “Today I lost a childhood friend for whom I had immense affection. The beautiful memories of what we lived will never be forgotten. My condolences to the family,” described Yasmin Tavarez.
