> BLOOMFIELD, NJ — A “March to Protect Transgender Youth” in Bloomfield will honor the life of a local preteen, Damien Lopez, who died last year.
> 
> According to a news release from organizers:
> 
> “Bloomfield LGBTQ+ Pride and a group of concerned local residents will co-host a march to commemorate a local pre-teen who lost their life to suicide. This ‘March to Protect Transgender Youth’ will travel through downtown Bloomfield on Saturday, Oct. 22 from 2 to 4 p.m. A number of local and state representatives, LGBTQ organizations, health care, and suicide prevention organizations, and other allies of LGBTQ+ rights will participate in this march and will host information tables in the Bloomfield Free Public Library courtyard.”
> The volunteer committee for the initiative – operating under the name “Damien’s Voice” – is also collecting funds to purchase and install a memorial bench in the late youth’s memory. A GoFundMe fundraising campaign to pay for the bench and help defray costs of holding the Oct. 22 memorial march has surpassed its goal of $6,000. Learn more or make a donation here.

> This GoFundMe is to raise funds to pay for a memorial bench in honor of Damien Lopez, a local trans youth who tragically lost their life to suicide in March of 2021. In addition the funds will assist the family with costs associated with a memorial march in Bloomfield, NJ. On Oct. 22, 2022 we will be hosting a MARCH TO PROTECT TRANS YOUTH. The march will travel through downtown Bloomfield and end at the Bloomfield Public Library. The memorial tribute bench will be placed in the Library courtyard. Bloomfield Pride LGBTQ Community of Bloomfield New Jersey will match the first $150 of donations. All of our LGBTQ+ youth are vulnerable in the current climate of political and social polarization. We feel lucky to live in a community where diversity is celebrated. Any donation amount will help make an impact. Thank you in advance for your contribution to this cause that means so much to Damien's family and the general community of Bloomfield, NJ.
