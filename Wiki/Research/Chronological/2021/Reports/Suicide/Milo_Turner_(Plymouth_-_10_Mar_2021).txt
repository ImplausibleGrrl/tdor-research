> Hello, I work with a Trans Support Group based in Plymouth, UK. In March 2021 we lost one of our members, Milo Turner, when he took his own life. I've tried to contact his sister who informed us of his passing for more details, but I haven't had a response yet. The best date we can currently give is March 10th
