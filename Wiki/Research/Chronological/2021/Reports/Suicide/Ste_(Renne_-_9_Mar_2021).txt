> On March 9, we learned of the suicide of Sté, a transgender person of whom we were friends, relatives, and comrades.
> 
> His funeral took place on Monday 15 in the presence of his family and friends.
> 
> Sté has fought all her life against gender-based violence, against hetero-patriarchy, against precariousness, against pedocriminality, it is this violence that killed her.
> 
> Sté had several lawsuits in progress, including one against an attacker. His parents wish to continue these legal proceedings and obtain justice, out of respect and love for Sté and his struggles.
> 
> These steps involve paying attorneys' fees and settling debts and fines that Sté had. We are organizing this fund for his family, we want to help his parents finance part of Sté's funeral but also support their decision to continue the legal fight for their child.
