> Heidi Saadiya, a 24-year-old YouTuber and journalist, was one day away from her birthday when she heard the news. “I always get together on my birthday with my sisters and friends, especially Anannyah. She’s more of a sister to me than my own siblings,” the resident of the southern Indian state of Kerala told VICE World News. “Instead, I got a big shock.”
> 
> On July 20, Saadiya found out that Anannyah Kumari Alex had been found dead in her apartment. Kerala is considered India’s most educated state, and 28-year-old Alex was somewhat of a legend.
> 
> She was Kerala’s first transgender radio jockey, a professional makeup artist, a news anchor and, most recently, the state’s first transgender candidate for legislative assembly elections.
> 
> Days before her death, Alex told a media outlet called The Cue that she became a victim of “gross medical negligence” during her gender confirmation surgery in June 2020 at a private hospital called Renai Medicity. “My private part looks like a piece of meat,” she said in a video interview. “I want to conduct a resurgery. I want justice.”
> 
> The local police told state media that death by suicide is suspected. “More details can be told only after conducting a post-mortem,” a police official told The NewsMinute. 
> 
> But Alex’s friends, family and community members call it an “institutional murder.” “We’re waiting for the postmortem report and analysis from the police officials,” said Saadiya. “She had achieved so much and dedicated her life to equality and justice. But her surgery had made her body very weak. She was unable to function properly.”
> 
> Saadiya, who is Kerala’s first trans woman TV journalist, added that she herself got her gender confirmation surgery five years ago, but recovered in time. “Anannyah had to change her sanitary napkin at least eight times a day due to fluids and bleeding.” 
> 
> Alex had been speaking up about her gender confirmation surgery experience for several months, on social media and news outlets. In one news interview with the regional publication Mathrubhumi, Alex said the Renai Medicity doctors “slashed [her] body here and there”. 
> 
> In yet another interview, she said she couldn’t stand, sneeze, laugh, brush her teeth or even breathe properly. “The money for the surgeries are painstakingly made by many through sex work, pooling from here and there, and even begging,” she had said. “Why are marginalised people like us being attacked like this for money?”
