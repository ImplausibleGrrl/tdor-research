Lucca Gomes - suicide - Belo Horizonte/Minas Gerais/Brazil, 23 years old. 17/02/2021

February 17, 2021, a date I will never forget.
We lost! The world loses, society loses, I lose... The theme CIS won this time! And that's exactly why I wake up every day, work, hurt, fight, fight, fight, fight often lonely, incomprehensible...
Sometimes we get tired... Tired of not seeing this shit world get better, of not seeing people be better... Tired of seeing so many people suffering, sad that they can't be who they are and be respected for it. There's no space, there's no opening, there's no...
14 years working mostly with and for LGBTI people and families and even more with trans people and families... And nothing compares to today. To the pain of today...
Yes, a psychologist also cries, it's also people... And today I cry... I cry for another one of our people who surrendered to all of this... Who fought, fought, fought, fought, but what a tired! Yes TRANSFOBIA KILLS It kills everyday! Kill and destroy many families!
Amazing, sweet, caring, fun boy who I didn't get to meet in person and not to hug, because we met in the pandemic. Yes, our paths crossed... And I'm grateful! Yes, grateful to every word, every share, every moment shared. Time was short, but it was very powerful! Confidence! You believed and surrendered! And you could feel part of it! Part of what I've always wanted... That you've always kept...
I leave all my affection to the loving parents, Rosilene and Sérgio; to their family members; to their love, Tha; to friends... Ah... the carnival... how loved the carnival... We had already agreed to scrub in what comes ... there was no time... could not...
A sensation of helplessness... Punch in the stomach... A lack of breath, lack of hope, lack... But tomorrow is the day of a fresh start... Day to lift your head and continue... Fighting, fighting, fighting... Still haven't given up on doing something... not yet... but it hurts...
Thank you, LUCCA GOMES SOUTO-@transinho_, the sweetest '' transinho ''! I will continue to fight, for all and for so many, reminding myself of that smile


Motorcyclist dies when colliding with truck on BR-381, in Naque

Lucca Gomes was 23 years old and died when crashing his motorcycle against a truck
Lucca Gomes Souto, 23, died on Wednesday afternoon (17), who crashed his Honda PCX 150 motorcycle against a truck at kilometer 210 of the BR-381, between Naque and Periquito. The violent impact instantly killed the young man who was driving the motorcycle along the federal highway.

The Diário do Aço found out that Lucca was driving a motorcycle and, for reasons still unknown, traveled several meters in the opposite direction. The truck driver claimed to people at the crash site that he tried to avoid the collision, but had no chance of avoiding the crash. The truck ended up in a thicket on the side of the highway after the crash.

On impact, Lucca suffered several fractures and died at the accident site. After the work of the Civil Police forensics, the body was removed from the Medical-Legal Institute (IML) in Ipatinga by the Nova Aliança funeral home. The accident was registered by the Federal Highway Police.

People who passed through the site saw the female body, so Diário do Aço managed to ascertain that the victim of the biker is a young trans. He was born with the female reproductive system, but identifies himself as a man, and even changed the name to Lucca in his personal documents. Lucca was a professor of sociology and lived in the Sagrada Família neighborhood in Belo Horizonte.
