stabbed



Andrea Castillo/Néstor Moreno was stabbed in Calarcá, Quindío (Colombia) on 12 Feb 2021.

She was 32.

Note that most posts name her as Néstor Moreno Castillo - the one below is the only one to name her Andrea Castillo.

Néstor was her birth name, but comments under a post by Red Comunitaria Trans suggest she was not inclined to change it after transition. If that was the case, it may be that "Andrea Castillo" was a name she experimented with but did not adopt.

As always when there is some uncertainty over naming, caution is advised.



Nestor Moreno was murdered yesterday in Calarcá Quindío. They stabbed her to death. She was a very happy woman, she always wanted to be called and recognized as "La Nestor".

 She becomes the fifth trans woman killed in the first 6 weeks of the year.

Néstor Andrés Moreno Castillo, 32 years old, was assassinated at dawn this Thursday in the El Jazmín neighborhood sector in the avenida Colón de Calarcá area, they attacked her with a knife and from behind.

According to the information, people who were mobilizing around 4:00 in the morning found the victim lying on the floor and immediately notified the authorities who arrived at the site to find out what had happened.

Moreno Castillo was found with several stab injuries to his back. The scene of the events was cordoned off with the purpose of collecting material that would allow the investigation to advance and that the motives and authors of the criminal act could be clarified.

CTI personnel from the Office of the Attorney General of the Nation appeared in the judicial case, inspected the body and transferred it in the Mobile Criminalistics Unit to the local morgue to carry out the respective autopsy and delivery of the corpse to the family to give it a Christian burial.


A crime called Andrea at the cacique villa.

When I was 19 years old I met a super cheerful and spontaneous boy at one of those popular parties that they did every weekend in different neighborhoods of Calarcho, before that at the front of the Robledo school many were patching to get together with the neighbors of the Calarca institute; There I always felt like someone looked at me, but never gave a hunch to know who emanated that force that made me spin around.
One Saturday I managed to meet Nestor Moreno, who invited me to a beer and a good dialogue that with his joy made me laugh out loud and by the way with his dance he managed to catch charms and sighs at the time.
Therefore for things in life our tastes and our differences never managed to concrete things and when I saw it again I was presented as 'Andrea Castillo', a brunette girl with long hair and always with that spark of joy that managed to captivate a very dialogue inspiring and full of diversity.
Sadly I have learned of the indolence, indifference, hatreds rooted from a tares replicated by bigotry that feed many individuals who expose grudges and death in their wake.
For many people diverse orientation is an aberration, for others it is an unforgivable sin. But the truth and truth is who judges the spirit is God and who exercises justice here on earth is man; Therefore, to live together in the midst of ′ ′ sinners ′ ′ they agree basic rules that will respect one and the other.
Today on a small walk where I used to travel and between tertulias about his departure, we call the LGBT + Population the clarification and truth of this murder that mourns a family and many social leaders of the department.
