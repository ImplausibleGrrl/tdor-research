Diamond was found in a parking lot suffering from a gunshot wound. She died in hospital.

> She was 23-years-old, born and raised in Cincinnati. On March 3, she became the latest Black trans woman murdered in the U.S.
> 
> Her name was Diamond Kyree Sanders. She also was known as Diamond Nicole.
> 
> Cincinnati police responded to a report of a person shot on Morrison Avenue around 3:42 a.m., according to a Wednesday afternoon news release. They discovered the wounded 23-year-old Kyree Sanders in a parking lot. Firefighters took Sanders to a hospital, where she died.
> 
> Police at first said it might have been a bias crime, then claimed it was ‘greed’ because her purse was stolen. I still don’t understand why the police are so quick to jump to conclusions about motive when they haven’t even caught the murderer. They don’t know the shooter was the one who stole her purse. Or that it was the motive rather than a hasty decision, perhaps to delay identifying the victim? I’m not clear on why it took so long for her death to be acknowledged by the media.
> 
> Diamond studied at The Ohio State University and had recently been working at Nordstrom.  She had thousands of friends on Facebook and her timeline was filled many cute, fashionable photos. The obituary written by her family speaks volumes to her dynamic personality and how much she was loved. Her 24th birthday would have been on April 10.

Diamond's obituary reads:

> “Diamond was a ball of energy as a child and even up to her time of death. She valued her family and enjoyed spending time with them. As a child, she would say “I love my WHOLE family!” At the last family Thanksgiving dinner, Diamond let her family know she was thankful that they accepted her for who she was as a transgender. In her younger years, Diamond spent many weekends with her Aunt Terron and Grandmother Dianne, baking cookies and making one of her favorite meals, “pigs in a blanket”. They also took Diamond and her siblings on trips to the Bahamas, Florida (Walt Disney World), Detroit and Gatlinburg to show her the world is much bigger than just Cincinnati.”
> 
> “As an adult, Diamond was a traveler, known to be in New York City one week and New Orleans the following week. Diamond was really into fashion. She always coordinated her attire from head to toe, including matching hair and nails. She was known to say, “I have to be cute, honey!” A few weeks before her death she was in her grandmother’s closet putting on her fur coat, clothes, and jewelry. Diamond’s unique style, charm, and personality will be greatly missed.”
