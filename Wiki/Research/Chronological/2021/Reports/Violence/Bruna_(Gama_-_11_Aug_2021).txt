Eu conhecia . Sempre nos domigos ela ia la pra feira azul do gama. Sempre acompanhada de outros moradores de rua. Não podia mim ver que me abraçava. Dizia ser grata por eu fornecer comida pra ela. Muito triste. A pessoa ja vive na rua em total miséria ainda acha um pra matar.

"I knew her. She always went there on Sundays to the blue fair of Gama. She was always accompanied by other homeless people. I can remember her hugging me. Said she was grateful for me providing her with food. Very sad. The person already lives on the street in total misery still finds one to kill."
