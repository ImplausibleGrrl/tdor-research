> MARCUS CHAVIS, 35, of Dorchester was arraigned today in the Dorchester Division of the Boston Municipal Court on two counts of murder and one count of animal cruelty. At the request of District Attorney Ian Polumbaum, Judge Thomas Kaplanes ordered Mr. Chavis held without bail.
> 
> ADA Polumbaum, Chief of District Attorney Rollins’ Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Unit, told the court that Mr. Chavis called 911 shortly before 12:30 p.m. Sunday and allegedly reported that he had stabbed his wife. Responding officers arrived at the Taft Street building where Mr. Chavis, Ms. Yasin and two children resided with Ms. DeAlto and encountered Mr. Chavis in the front entrance. His clothing had blood on it, prosecutors said. Inside the apartment, officers were met by the two young children, who were present in the home at the time of the murders.
> 
> The officers located Ms. Yasin and Ms. DeAlto in separate bedrooms, each suffering from serious stab wounds to the neck. Tragically, both victims succumbed to their injuries. A dog with a stab wound was also located in the same bedroom as Ms. DeAlto and taken to MSPCA Angell Animal Medical Center for treatment.
> 
> The children who were present were physically uninjured and are currently safe and being cared for.
> 
> The Elizabeth Freeman Center, a support center for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault where Jahaira DeAlto worked, told NBC 10 Boston that she was “an activist and survivor who touched the lives of everyone around her with her passion, drive, humanity, humor, and fierce vision”
> 
> “My thoughts are with the families and loved ones of the two women whose lives were violently stolen,” District Attorney Rollins said. “Staff assigned to my office’s Victim Witness Assistance Program have been in contact with the victims’ families to extend our condolences and to provide ongoing support and resources, especially for the children whose lives have been forever changed. We have also reached out to stakeholders within Boston’s transgender community, which Ms. DeAlto was dedicated to elevating. We are here to support the families, individuals and communities impacted by Ms. DeAlto and Ms. Yasin’s murders as they begin their long journey toward healing,” District Attorney Rollins said.

> The activist is being remembered by the community for how loving she was as well as her fight for equality and for victims of abuse.

> The ballroom community is mourning the death of a legend this week after news broke that activist Jahaira DeAlto died after being stabbed on Sunday.
> 
> "The House of Balenciaga regretfully acknowledges the death/murder of our own Jahaira M. DeAlto, a community advocate and friend to many," Harold Balenciaga wrote to Facebook Sunday night. "Let us not forget her ongoing work against domestic abuse and continue to uplift her name and ensure her memory lives on in this ironic twist of fate." The killing makes DeAlto the 21st reported trans killing this year, putting 2021 on track to be the deadliest on record for trans Americans. She is the seventh trans woman of color to be killed in a month.
> 
> Within ballroom, DeAlto was a member of the House of Balenciaga. She made her name in Boston, and became a legend for the category of realness. In her subcategory, fem queen realness, trans women competed to pass for cisgender women. DeAlto's specialty was everyday realness. She started walking in 1996, first walking runway and then in 1999 she began walking realness. After her first winning ball walking realness, she stuck with the category. She also built her own devoted personal family, helping to nurture other members of the community. She wrote about that experience last year on Mother's Day.
> 
> "I am the mother who raised the children whose rainbow sparkled too brightly and blinded their birth moms," she wrote to Twitter in a thread. "I cherished what they discarded. I took on earthly assignments for moms who'd earned their Heavenly reward. For their babies who still needed raising. I did that. And I'm still doing that. And I'll keep doing that. Because I will never know what seeing my DNA reflected in another's eyes could look like, but I know what gratitude in the eyes of a young person who finally feels seen looks like. And for me, that's enough."
> 
> But she was also a vocal activist outside the scene, having begun that work in 1995.
> 
> For years DeAlto operated a YouTube channel vlogging about her life, speaking out on social justice issues, and also talking about inner-community conversations regarding trans women.
> 
> "The mission is all about helping you place yourself on a higher priority in your own life, and essentially living the best life that you possibly can, the most authentic life, the life that is true to you," she said in an introductory video to the channel. Her activism work included speaking at various events like Trans Day of Remembrance rallies and more — she was the emcee and featured speaker at the Berkshires' first Transgender Day of Remembrance event n 201.
> 
> “It’s important to be visible,” she told Freedom Massachusetts while she was a student at Berkshire Community College of her work. She's since spoken at the Ryan White Conference on HIV/AIDS, Harvard University, and was a guest lecturer at Columbia University's School of Social work. “It is still vitally important we leverage our privilege to provide educational opportunities for people to learn more. The more we humanize ourselves for those who don’t think they’ve encountered a transgender person, the more we’re able to remove the stigma and fear surrounding the perception of what trans people are. Education is our greatest weapon against ignorance. After having the experience of meeting Jahaira DeAlto, you can no longer say you’ve never met a trans person.” DeAlto graduated from Berkshire Community College in August 2019 with an Associate's Degree in Human Services.
> 
> On Sunday, in Boston a 34-year-old man named Marcus Chavis was arrested in connection with murder charges in the death of two women. The women were reportedly stabbed. One died on the scene while the other suffered serious injuries, was transported to a hospital, and later died. A dog was was also injured. It is believed that one of the women was DeAlto. 
> 
> This is the last death within ballroom. Boogie Revlon Makavelli was also killed last month and Vjaun Allure died earlier this year. Jack Mizrahi Gucci, an icon within the community recently posted about the deaths. Over the weekend he attended a ball in Chicago.
> 
> "I came to give tribute to the greats we've lost," he wrote, including hashtags for Allure, Makavelli, Jasmine Ferre, Doodie Aphrodite, and Honey Mizrahi. "Rest in Peace, my friends."

> She was a noted trans activist that began her journey at the age of 16 in the early 90s in Boston. She was a noted speaker and organizer of Trans Day of Remembrance.
> 
> She later became an advocate and case worker for survivors of intimate partner violence and continued to do what she called “normalizing the trans and experience for cisgender people.” She did this by helping families of trans kids come together as a family to grow.
> 
> She has contributed state wide to the growth of Massachusetts creation safety for trans people. Trans women still experience an epidemic of some of the highest homicide rates in this country.
> 
> It is unfortunate to have her die in her own home by the hands of somebody else. Details are still fuzzy but I’m realizing having a person in custody doesn’t bring me peace. Just more questions.
> 
> I beg of all you, please have these tough conversations. Please realizing that trans folks are still in danger. We need to create a safer world for our trans folks. Trans women deserve to grow old. [#TransLivesMatter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/TransLivesMatter)
