MEMPHIS, Tenn. — A man has been charged after police say he shot and killed a man in Southwest Memphis in the 3000 block of Ford Road just before 2:30 pm on Sunday.

Prior to the shooting, investigators say there was some sort of argument between the victim and another man.

Police say the victim didn’t survive his injuries.

Witnesses told WREG they heard 2 to 3 gunshots and saw a man hit the pavement. It’s unclear what the two men were arguing about, but regardless, neighbors say changes are needed.
