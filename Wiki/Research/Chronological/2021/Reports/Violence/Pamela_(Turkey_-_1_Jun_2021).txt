> To be very honest Iam trying my best to divert my frustrations but it's really hard, very very hard, how does one calm down when they loose a special friend? A very close friend?  
> 
> I lost a best friend and a beautiful trans gender girl this afternoon. 
> 
> I met Pamela when I was a refugee in Kenya, she had run away from DRC Congo , I had run away from Uganda. 
>
> Unfortunately when she arrived in Kenya running away from transphobia in Congo, UNHCR Kenya could not register her in time. 
> 
> Me and her attended a United Nations Youth Summit  in Kenya representing trans gender refugees  and all LGBQ+ refugees in Africa and she met a friend through the summit from Turkey who helped her travel to Turkey.
> 
> This morning she was found dead in her apartment, her head had been cut off completely  by unknown people .
> 
> This particular girl and I have been two resilient and enduring human beings , we have shared our wins and struggles together. 
> 
> The level at which trans gender persons with an African origin get murdered all the time by unknown people and justice never  gets served is devastating.
> 
> Iam so hurt beyond measure, Iam honestly so hurt.
> 
> Tonight I just feel like laying low, not talk to nobody and let this pain sink in too and take big breaths .
