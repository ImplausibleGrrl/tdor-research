Homicides of transgender people in Ceará
Ceará appears as the second state in which more transvestite and transgender people were murdered last year . This is what the "Dossier: murders and violence against Brazilian transvestites and transsexuals in 2019" shows, prepared by the National Association of Transvestites and Transsexuals of Brazil (Antra).

According to the report, based on information obtained by the association with people and media outlets from all states, 11 transgender people were killed violently in the state. Ceará is only behind São Paulo, where 21 people were killed last year.

The homicides occurred in Fortaleza, Chorozinho, Sobral, Guaiuba, Horizonte, Pacatuba, Maracanaú, Caucaia, Tarrafas and Juazeiro do Norte

Altogether, in the last three years, 40 trans people were murdered in Ceará. In this regard, the state also appears in second place, along with Bahia and behind only São Paulo, whose murders totaled 51.

On February 26, 2019, Ana Lima, 40, was shot dead in Bairro Alto São João , in Pacatuba, in the Metropolitan Region of Fortaleza. According to the Metropolitan Police Station of Maracanaú, which received the case, witnesses heard about three gunshots fired. Ana was shot in the head and died on the spot.

On September 20, a transvestite identified as Bruna Surfistinha, 26, was shot to death while bathing inside a residence in the municipality of Chorozinho, in the Metropolitan Region of Fortaleza. Witnesses say two men were seen running out of the scene after the crime.

On the morning of October 12, 2019, a transvestite identified as Julia was shot dead in Bairro Sumaré, in the municipality of Sobral , 200 km from Fortaleza. According to the police, two men arrived on foot in the street where she was and carried out several firearm shots at the victim, then fleeing.

Ceará is also the second in the country to register homicide attempts against the transgender population - dividing its position in the violent ranking with Rio Grande do Sul. There were five attempts in 2019, with records in the cities of Fortaleza and Juazeiro do Norte, and behind São Paulo again, with 12 IDs.
