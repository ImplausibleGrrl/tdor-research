They keep killing us ðŸ˜¡
The fellow Trans YERAY HURTADO to whom her friends also knew as Teresa, was the victim of Transfeminicide on Tuesday, April 13 in the neighborhood of the town of Cali City (Valle del Cauca).
Trans people are still in constant danger and in many cases our deaths are invisibilized and in total impunity ðŸ˜¡.
We demand that the prosecutor's office and the guarantor institutions of rights investigate these cases, that our deaths do not remain in impunity and the Colombian State to be guaranteed our rights to a worthy life and full citizenship ðŸ‘Š: trans:
