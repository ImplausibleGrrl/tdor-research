Natalia Maldonado was shot in Granadero Baigorria, Santa Fe (Argentina) on 10 Jan 2021.

She was 24. #SayHerName #TransLivesMatter #TDoR


Natalia Maldonado was 24 when a flurry of gunfire ended her life projects, which included starting to study to quit sex work, a destination to which transgender women are still condemned despite the efforts of the areas of the State and theLGTBIQ + collective in order to have a decent life. Her friends and relatives remember her as a faithful companion, very loving and defender of the trans community.

Natalia lived alone in a house located in the Nuestra Señora de La Paz neighborhood, on a street known as Camino Muerto , in the southwest of Granadero Baigorria . They assure that their economic situation was not the best at the time. And although she was not a militant in any space, she received the help of food bags to be able to weather the economic crisis, since she was dedicated to sex work like so many other girls in the group.

Those who have known Natalia Maldonado "since she was 11 years old" assure that she was a good friend, that she had no problems with anyone. "He had a strong character but that is not why he stopped being a good, kind and loving person," Natalia Maldonado's friends, who used to get together to drink mates during the afternoons , told La Capital . In turn, they assured: "She had no problems with anyone ."

A humble life
"Natalia was a 24-year-old girl; blonde, synaptic, companion; a person who was in all of them and never left you alone . She liked to go shopping and we would get together to eat from time to time. People who knew her know that he had his character, but he defended his own " , they reviewed.

They also comment that Natalia was going through a delicate economic situation due to the fact that her activity did not allow her to obtain a regular purchasing power, and to this it was added that in the last two months "her house was robbed several times".

"During the weekends she rested and there we took the opportunity to get together to eat; she was a quiet girl, she did not take drugs, she was a healthy person who wanted to start studying and project her life because she wanted to leave the street and get a job," commented close friends Natalia to add that the news of the fatal outcome fell "like a bucket of cold water."

Why they killed Natalia Maldonado
While the Public Prosecutor's Office works to arrive at the hypothesis of the crime perpetrated in the early hours of this Sunday, from their environment they still do not know the reason why Natalia Maldonado was murdered. In principle they believe that he was in the middle of the shots. "We do not know what she was doing, we understand that she was having something with friends, because she did not work on weekends," they said.

Sources close to the investigation confided to the Capital that the crime was perpetrated at midnight in Montevideo and Quito, in the neighboring town. In that place, 24 9-millimeter caliber served pods were lifted, although the attackers had not yet been identified when they arrived at noon.

Unofficial sources indicated that the perpetrators of the shooting arrived at the scene aboard two motorcycles and a Chevrolet Onix. Meanwhile, sources close to the investigation indicated that a few blocks away a gray vehicle with similar characteristics to those provided by witnesses was hijacked and that it had bullet holes in one of its doors. However, they could not confirm if it is the same car.

Meanwhile, a 20-year-old was also injured as a result of the shooting attack, but is out of danger.
