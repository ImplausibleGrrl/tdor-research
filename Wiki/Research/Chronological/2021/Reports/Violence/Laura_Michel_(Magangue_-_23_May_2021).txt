> The inhabitants of the municipality of Magangué woke up this Sunday with unfortunate news. Another violent event mourns a family from that population and they only ask for greater vigilance from the authorities.
> 
> At dawn, people reported to the Police the discovery of a corpse in a lonely alley in the La Esmeralda neighborhood, near the municipality's skating rink.
> 
> After inspecting the body, the patrols reported that it was a trans woman known in the town as 'la Loncha' or 'Laura Michel'. After identifying her, they announced that on the citizenship card it appears with the name of Robinson Benavides Torres.
> 
> The victim was wearing a red blouse and jean. I have suffered blows to the abdomen, arms and face. His left eye was shattered. The first hypothesis speaks of a brutal death by blows and knives.
