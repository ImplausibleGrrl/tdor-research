While on Friday, June 11, Andrea Mutz González, 28, was shot to death near her residence on 11 avenue and second street in zone two of Guatemala City. This trans woman was a renowned activist for the human rights of trans people in Guatemala and president of the organization Otrans RN Reinas de la Noche. 

Municipal firefighters covered and transferred Andrea to the San Juan de Dios General Hospital. From the official statements, the firefighter spokesman Omar Ovalle violated Andrea's gender identity by mentioning that she was “male”. While they emphasized to the emergency doctors of said hospital  "he is a man" , without the doctor having asked him. 

According to sources close to Presentes and who preferred anonymity, several hypotheses are discussed. Among them, that Andrea was being the victim of extortion. Another source indicates that for his work in the defense of human rights he had received threats and sent complaints to the Public Ministry.

In her intense journey as an activist, Andrea had worked on a regional human rights project and was a fellow of the US Department of State's International Visitor Leadership Program (IVLP). 

The Network of Human Rights Defenders of Guatemala denounced the transfemicide through a statement: “With indignation and pain as the Network of Human Rights Defenders of Guatemala, we issue this urgent alert, we condemn the fact and we call on the Public Ministry to carry out the corresponding investigations and those responsible are found to guarantee prompt justice in the case of the companion. We also call on the Human Rights Ombudsman's Office to accompany the process as well as international organizations on the matter . "
