Trans woman Bianca “Muffin” Bankz murdered in her apartment
Added by Kelli Busey on January 29, 2021.

Bianca “Muffin” Bankz a trans woman of color was found murdered in her apartment Sunday, January 17, 2021. Details surrounding her death are murky, but friends say but that her life was taken by a man in her home, who ultimately took his own life.

Bianca “Muffin” Bankz is the second transgender woman to be murdered in Atlanta in the past 18 days. Bonaire (Bonni) Black, 19, was found dead on December 31, 2020, under a blanket in a parking garage in midtown Atlanta.

Jesse Pratt López founder of the Trans Housing Coalition (THC) wrote on Facebook “during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have worked nonstop to get as many trans and nonbinary people off the streets and into relative safety as quickly as possible. These efforts have often extended to people who were not enrolled in our program, but connected to our clients.”

“We met Muffin when we were unable to take on any new clients. Because she was good friends with our client, Africa, she became Africa’s roommate and we were able to at least provide housing for her over the past few months.”

Muffin and Africa knew each other for eight years. They were homeless together, lived together in emergency housing, and just last month moved into an apartment together with our help. According to Africa, Muffin was a good friend, a girl who “if you forgot the butter [at the store] she already had it.”

Muffin didn’t have a relationship with her blood family. She was a child of the foster care system in Florida and moved to Atlanta in her early 20s where she found her chosen family. She and Africa were so close, that Africa’s mother became like a mother to her too.

Muffin was blossoming into herself. She had recently begun her medical transition in November. Her hope, according to Africa, was to compete on RuPaul’s Drag Race. They were supposed to compete together.

Bianca “Muffin” Bankz
A vigil will be held at her home at 1177 Joseph E. Boone Blvd NW on Friday, January 29th at 6:00 pm. It will be cold so please dress accordingly. Bring candles, stuffed animals, flowers, offerings (Muffins!), and red angel wings if you can find any! There will be prayers, performances from community members, and whatever else folks are called to.

The Trans Housing Coalition has decided to move forward with covering all of Muffin’s funeral expenses. You can also donate to Africa—Muffin’s chosen family and roommate—and support her during this difficult time (cashapp: $Africa1921).

Bianca “Muffin” Bankz, God rest her soul, is the 15th transgender person murdered in the US since November 20, 2020, our last Transgender Day of Remembrance (TDoR).
