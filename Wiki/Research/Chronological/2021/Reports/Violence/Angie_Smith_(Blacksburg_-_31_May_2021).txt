> Transgender woman Angie Smith beaten to death by Virginia Tech Linebacker
> Warning: video is illustrative of the mainstream media reporting: Victim blaming, deadnaming, misgendering, and violent graphic content.
> 
> June 10, 2021
>
> Virginia Tech Linebacker Isimemen Etute, 18 met Angie “Gigi” Smith at her apartment on May 31st for sex then knocked her teeth out, broke all of the bones in her face, and broke her skull. Angie Smith was pronounced dead at the scene by police.
> 
> On Friday, a spokesperson for the family said they are trying to come to terms with whatever happened. Smith has an older brother who was close with her nephews, who nicknamed her Gigi.
> 
> “We are so at a loss at everything that’s going on,” said the spokesperson, who requested anonymity based on fears of online harassment. The family has been dismayed at the speculation about the case they are seeing on the internet, the person said.
> 
> Warning this video is illustrative of the mainstream media reporting: Victim blaming, deadnaming, misgendering, and violent graphic content.
> 
> “Prosecutors say Etute met Smith through a dating app, the pair met, at which time Smith reportedly gave Etute oral sex.”
> 
> “According to testimony, the two met up again, but it was at that time Etute “realized” Smith was a man, prosecutors say.”
> 
> “The Commonwealth contends Etute became angry and punched Smith multiple times in the face. In addition, he allegedly stomped on Smith with so much force that it broke every bone in (sic)her face.”
> 
> Assistant Commonwealth’s Attorney Jason Morgan argued against bail on June 9th hearing, and outlined new details about the case based on statements Etute gave to the police.
> 
> According to those statements, Etute visited the victim’s apartment April 10 for oral sex after he was matched up with someone named “Angie” on Tinder. Etute returned to the apartment May 31 to engage in sexual activity and discovered the person he was matched up with was a man, according to summaries of the evidence made by both Morgan and defense attorney Jimmy Turk.
> 
> Etute also told police that Smith did not assault him.
> 
> Etute told the police he punched the victim five times in the face and continued punching the victim when the person hit the ground and “stomped” on him. He heard “bubbling and gurgling” as he left the apartment, but didn’t call the police.
> 
> Turk’s response to Morgan outlining the circumstances of the case was to emphasize that the victim solicited Etute for sexual activity.
> 
> “I’m not saying what happened was acceptable, but this was more than someone just showing up to an apartment and punching someone,” Turk told the court.
> 
> “Nobody deserves to die, but I don’t mind saying, don’t pretend you are something that you are not,” Etute’s defense attorney told reporters outside the courtroom. “Don’t target or lure anyone under that perception. That’s just wrong.”
> 
> Mainstream news reports place the blame on Angie Smith for ‘fooling’ Etute, despite the linebacker confessing that the two had sex days before he returned to her apartment for sex and subsequently beat her to death.
> 
> The New York Post headline is utterly sickening “Virginia Tech linebacker accused of beating man to death over Tinder catfishing”.
> 
> This is a classic “Trans Panic” style defense that was outlawed by the Virginia legislature. Democratic Delegate Danica Roem originally wrote and sponsored the Virginia bill. Roem is one of eight trans legislators in the country and Virginia is the only southern state to have outlawed the trans/gay panic defense.
> 
> HB 2132 Summary as passed:
> 
> “Homicides and assaults and bodily woundings; certain matters not to constitute defenses. Provides that another person’s actual or perceived sex, gender, gender identity, or sexual orientation is not in and of itself, or together with an oral solicitation, a defense to any charge of capital murder, murder in the first degree, murder in the second degree, voluntary manslaughter, or assault and bodily wounding-related crimes and is not provocation negating or excluding malice as an element of murder.”
> 
> Etute’s preliminary hearing is set for Sept. 23.
> 
> Fortunately the trans panic defense has been banned in VA thanks to @pwcdanica

> 
> To break down the timeline:
> 
> Jan. 12: I filed HB 2132 to ban the LGBTQ+ panic defense.
> Feb. 25: It passed the General Assembly.
> March 31: The governor signed it into law.
> May 31: The murder.
> July 1: The bill goes into effect.
> Some time well after July 1: The trial for the murder.

> Virginia Tech Football Isi Etute Murder Case ... LB Allegedly Beat Man To Death Over Catfishing Incident
> 6/9/2021 1:59 PM PT
> 
> Blacksburg Police Department
> Suspended Virginia Tech linebacker Isi Etute told cops he beat the hell out of a 40-year-old after the man had catfished him ... this according to prosecutors.
> 
> Officials made the stunning revelation in a Virginia courtroom Wednesday ... explaining Etute broke it all down for cops during their murder investigation days ago.
> 
> Prosecutors say Etute told the cops he had matched with a person named "Angie" on Tinder believing she was a woman -- and had met up with her for oral sex on April 10.
> 
> Officials say Etute then told cops he and "Angie" set up another date on May 31, but when he discovered there that she was actually a man -- the football player attacked.
> 
> 
> Virginia Tech Athletics
> Prosecutors say Etute told cops he punched the victim several times in the face and also stomped on him.
> 
> Prosecutors say Etute added that he did not call cops after the attack, despite hearing "bubbling and gurgling" as he left the apartment.
> 
> The man was found dead two days later ... with officials saying he had missing teeth and broken bones in his face and skull.
> 
> But, Etute's attorney, Jimmy Turk, appeared to defend the football player's alleged actions ... saying in court, "Nobody deserves to die, but I don’t mind saying, don’t pretend you are something that you are not."
> 
> "Don’t target or lure anyone under that perception. That’s just wrong."
> 
> Etute -- who's been charged with 2nd-degree murder -- was granted bail at the hearing and is due back in court in September.
> 
> The linebacker, meanwhile, had participated in Va. Tech's 2021 spring practices and was expected to compete for a role on the team this year ... but he's since been barred from the team as the case plays out in court.

Note that this might be a controversial case:

[TL;DR: the victim was alleged to be catfishing younger men for sex under the name "Angie Renee"]
