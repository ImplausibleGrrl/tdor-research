Trans activist found dead in Puerto Montt
This is Valentina Vera López, a collaborator of Movilh-Los Lagos. Nearby they suspect murder. The Movilh, which is currently at the scene, hopes that the Gabriela Law will be applied.

Lifeless and lying on her bed this morning the trans collaborator of the Homosexual Integration and Liberation Movement (Movilh-Los Lagos), Valentina Vera López (32), was found amid suspicions of a transphobic crime.

The body was found in the Torres Molinos cabins, located at 680 Benavente Street in Puerto Montt, where the Carabineros Criminalistics Laboratory (Labocar) is currently located, together with the victim's relatives and the Movilh-Los Lagos spokesperson, José Arcos.

“We are shocked by the passing of our partner. There is a lot of sadness. We will be accompanying the family at all times to find out the truth of these events and punish anyone responsible, in the event that it is a crime, as the first inquiries have suspected so far, ”said Arcos.

He added that witnesses "last night saw Valentina with a subject, whose identity we hope will be promptly known by the police, in order to know exactly what happened."

"If it is a hate crime, we will legally represent the family, and we will make use of the Gabriela Law, inasmuch as it typifies crimes against trans people as femicide, considering gender identity as a protected category," he explained .

“For years we have known of abuses and crimes against LGBTIQ + people, but that now the affected person is a partner in our cause and fight, has a special impact on a personal level. We will not rest until justice is done ”, concluded Arcos.
