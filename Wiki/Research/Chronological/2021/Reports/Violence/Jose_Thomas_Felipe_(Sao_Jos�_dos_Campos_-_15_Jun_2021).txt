> 
> According to the lawyer, the shelving of the investigation is a “negligence”.
> 
> “The suspect, he threatened the victim a few days before the disappearance. He too confessed to the crime. So we have all the requirements for this case not to be filed. The LGBT population here in São José, they are afraid. Because we are not getting a response from the authorities in this case, which is a very serious case. LGBT+ people in Brazil all suffer a lot from the issue of homicide. It is the country that kills the most LGBT, it is the country that kills the most transsexuals. The position of the Public Ministry, it shows a disregard of the authorities with the trans population of São José dos Campos”, said William.
> 
> As the victim's sister explained, this Friday's demonstration is also in favor of all people who are victims of transphobia.
> 
> “For the whole community. Trans lives matter. It's not just me, as Thomas's sister, but there are many families suffering, because there are many trans people murdered and impunity is very high in this case”, lamented Priscila Aparecida.
