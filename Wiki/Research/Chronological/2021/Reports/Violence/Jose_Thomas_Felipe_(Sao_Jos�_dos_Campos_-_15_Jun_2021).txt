> Justice accepted the charge of murder against a man suspected of the death of Thomas Felipe, 29, a transgender man who lived in São José dos Campos (SP). The Public Ministry even asked for the case to be closed, but after a series of protests and a change of prosecutor , the case was denounced and the suspect became a defendant for the crime.
> 
> The case began on June 15th, when Thomas left home and did not return . According to the police, they suspected the crime of murder, after analyzing the exchanges of messages on the victim's cell phone. The investigation points out that a man has discovered the affair that Thomas had with his wife. Conversations with the woman and reports of threats were found.
> 
> After an examination on the phone, the police even took the man to the police station for testimony and he confessed to the crime and pointed out that he would have left Thomas' body near the Buquira River. However, after presenting a lawyer, the suspect backtracked and denied committing the crime.
> 
> Since then, police have been searching the area, but have not been able to find the victim's body. This is because, according to investigators, the victim would have been left there during the dry season and the river was shallower. Now, with the floods of rain, there are sections where it is not possible to access.
> 
> The police forwarded the investigation to the Justice appointing the man as the author of the murder. However, in March of this year, the Public Prosecutor who was with the case asked for the filing of the complaint and, with that, the suspension of the search for the body.
> 
> The family and organizations working on issues related to the rights of the LGBTQIA+ population protested against the MP's decision. The court denied the filing request and the case was referred to another prosecutor.
> 
> After the change, the case was reported to the courts and now accepted. With this, the man will answer for the suspicion of murder against the victim. His name has not been released and the case remains confidential.
> 
> Thomas left a five-year-old son. The case is accompanied by the Public Defender's Office, the Diversity Commission of the Brazilian Bar Association (OAB) of São José and the NGOs Transbordamos and Aliança Nacional LGBT

> “The demonstrations will continue until the prosecutor makes the complaint to the judge, so that we can reopen the process. He filed, for lack of body, even having all the facts that it was him. As long as we are unable to reopen this process, to continue the diligences, we will not give up”, said Thomas' sister to SP RIO+.

> The person responsible for filing the investigation is prosecutor Luiz Fernando Guedes Ambrogi.

> SP RIO+ had access to the Filing Promotion of the case, which justifies the decision by saying that “the elements of information gathered in the aforementioned procedure are not able to support any request for conviction in court.

> 
> According to the lawyer, the shelving of the investigation is a “negligence”.
> 
> “The suspect, he threatened the victim a few days before the disappearance. He too confessed to the crime. So we have all the requirements for this case not to be filed. The LGBT population here in São José, they are afraid. Because we are not getting a response from the authorities in this case, which is a very serious case. LGBT+ people in Brazil all suffer a lot from the issue of homicide. It is the country that kills the most LGBT, it is the country that kills the most transsexuals. The position of the Public Ministry, it shows a disregard of the authorities with the trans population of São José dos Campos”, said William.
> 
> As the victim's sister explained, this Friday's demonstration is also in favor of all people who are victims of transphobia.
> 
> “For the whole community. Trans lives matter. It's not just me, as Thomas's sister, but there are many families suffering, because there are many trans people murdered and impunity is very high in this case”, lamented Priscila Aparecida.

> He disappeared on June 15, 2021, after spending the day in a hospital with his grandmother, who was sick and passed away that afternoon.
> 
> He was last seen around 7pm that day, when he left the house via an app run to hand over a key to a friend.
> 
> The murder suspect, who came to confess the crime to the police, is a resident of the east side of the city. The crime took place in the Buquirinha neighborhood, in the north zone. There is a suspicion that the killer discovered that his wife was having an affair with Thomas.

> However, in the presence of his lawyer, the man changed his version and denied involvement in the murder.
> 
> So far, Thomas' body has not been found, despite the fact that the police have been searching for months in the region pointed out by the man, the Buquirinha River.
> 
> “Do it justice, right? Because a person cannot commit a crime and go unpunished. So do justice to see if justice wakes up and we can get this guy to pay for what he did.
