Michele Almeida was stabbed to death in Belo Horizonte

The transvestite who had been missing for four days was found dead by relatives at the Instituto MÃ©dico Legal (IML) in Belo Horizonte on Sunday (31).

The information shows that Michele Almeida, 45, was stabbed to death under a viaduct in the capital of Minas Gerais. Michele was a student at Transvest, an NGO coordinated by city councilwoman Duda Salabert that aims to combat transphobia and include transvestites, transsexuals and transgender people in society. 

For the councilwoman, Michele's death may have been related to her marginalization.

"According to reports, 77% of transsexuals murdered in Brazil occur with exaggerated violence, with exquisite cruelty, and she was possibly murdered working in prostitution. About 90% of transvestites in Brazil are unfortunately prostitution, because of society's prejudice. That is why it is important for us to fight for the employability of transvestite and transsexual people as a way to combat this structure of hatred ", he explains.

Duda Salabert said he will file a formal complaint with the Civil Police, demanding further investigations into the crime against Michele Almeida.
