Poetical was shot inside her vehicle late on the morning of Saturday 2nd October, but as a result of police misgendering her murder did not come to light until nearly two weeks later.

> A 26-year-old Black transgender woman from Pompano Beach was gunned down and killed late morning Saturday, Oct. 2, inside her Hummer on a residential Miami Gardens street.
> 
> Royal Poetical Starz is believed to be one of at least 40 trans, nonbinary or gender-nonconforming people reported slain this year in the United States, according to queer blogger Sue Kerr, who tracks these killings for her website, Pittsburgh Lesbian Correspondents. 
> 
> Kerr and South Florida trans activists, including Morgan and Ashley Mayfaire of TransSOCIAL, were stunned to learn from a reporter on Tuesday that a trans woman had been shot to death the week before in Northwest Miami-Dade County.
> 
> A prime reason they didn’t know: Miami Gardens police on Oct. 4 issued a news release stating that a 26-year-old “Black male” had been slain — alongside a photo of Poetical presenting herself as a woman.
> 
> Investigators haven’t said much about Poetical’s death, except it “occurred at the 4600 Block of NW 185th Street, in Miami Gardens” about 11:26 a.m., according to the police news release.
