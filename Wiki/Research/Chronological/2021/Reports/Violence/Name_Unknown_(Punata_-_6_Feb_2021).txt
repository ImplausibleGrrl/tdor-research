Trans Woman Found Dead in Hotel; activists cry out for justice and ask "until when"
It was a 19-year-old person. They found her lifeless, covered with sheets. 
DRAFTING February 6, 2021 (2:55 pm)


A 19-year-old trans woman was found lifeless in the bed of a hotel in the city. The alarm was raised by companions of the dead woman, who had offered sexual services, after considering it strange that the deceased did not answer messages or calls on WhatsApp.

The activist Raiza Torriani, leader of Red de Personas Trans de Bolivia (TREBOL), appeared at the place moved by the situation and reflected that, according to the records kept by the organization, this is the first death in these circumstances in 2021. This, regardless of others that are in the investigation stage and that were raised in other departments.

Torriani described the unfortunate scene. She said that her companions contacted her to tell her about what happened. The group handles the hypothesis that the client who shared a few moments with the now-deceased last night could have killed her. 

Torriani, visibly shocked by the events, called for justice and urged the authorities to act so that trans women "do not continue to be in danger."

In January, two tictokers from the LGBT community of La Paz were brutally beaten.



Peace.- The murder of a trans woman of 19 years in the Bolivian city of Cochabamba with signs of being strangled with the cord of an iron comb has caused Saturday condemnation and repudiation of organizations like the Defense of the People of the country .

The woman, who was engaged in prostitution, entered the room of an accommodation on Friday night with a client and no one knew what happened to her until her companions discovered the fatal outcome this morning after asking the administrator for the entrance to the room.

Around her neck was the cable of a hair straightener that possibly served the attacker to suffocate her and then cover her body with a sheet and escape from the place, local media reported.

The Office of the Ombudsman "requires the Public Ministry (Prosecutor's Office) and the Bolivian Police to investigate and punish this act that threatens life, physical integrity and human dignity," he said in a statement.

The entities that represent these groups such as the Organization of Transvestites, Transsexuals and Transgender of Bolivia (OTRAF) do not have a record of the number of attacks or hate crimes, although these events are recurrent.

A case with similar characteristics occurred in El Alto, the second most populous city in Bolivia, neighboring La Paz, in October last year.

Gabriela, a 19-year-old trans woman, was killed with nineteen stab wounds by her attacker, who then fled the scene after both entered an accommodation and without leaving evidence, since there were no security cameras in the place.

A case prior to Gabriela's death also occurred in El Alto in December 2018, when the trans woman Litzy Hurtado was murdered in a nightclub, in which she first received attacks from a group of men and was finally stabbed with a screwdriver that mortally wounded.

In January, two members of the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender community received a beating in El Alto, one of them with a mitten that caused his skull to collapse, according to the account of one of those attacked. EFE
