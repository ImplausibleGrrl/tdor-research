They kill a transgender person with stones in La Lima, Cortés
May 14, 2021
CORTÉS , HONDURAS . A transgender person was found dead this Friday in the Cerrato neighborhood, La Lima municipality.

According to information released by the National Police (PN) , the victim was killed with stones, although the reasons have not yet been ascertained. The name of the victim is also still unknown .

Neighbors of the neighborhood in question were those who, when they were about to start their work for the day, came across the grim scene. They immediately called the 911 emergency line to alert authorities.

The corpse lay face up on a sidewalk, bloody and with large lesions on its face. The build was slim. He was wearing black pants and a white shirt.

Members of the Police were present to verify the incident and cordon off the crime scene. Later, Forensic Medicine personnel of the Public Ministry (MP) did the lifting of the body.

Meanwhile, the Police Investigation Directorate (DPI) is already making the corresponding inquiries to find the whereabouts of the person (s) responsible.

The event occurred close to the commemoration date of the International Day against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia . It is celebrated on May 17 of each year to denounce the discrimination to which all people with sexual preferences different from conventional ones are subjected, such as homosexuals, transsexuals, bisexuals and lesbians around the world.

In 2021, the theme chosen for the campaign is  "Together: Resisting, Supporting, Healing!" , in a clear reference to the current context of recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.

The campaign for 2020 was  "Breaking the silence" , a slogan that tried to raise their voices so that people never have to hide their sexual condition, are not ashamed of who they are and so that all options are accepted by society.
