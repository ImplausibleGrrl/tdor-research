TOLUCA.-On the eve of the Gender Identity Law being discussed in the LX Legislature, Alin, a trans woman was murdered in the municipality of Mexicaltzingo, for which the LGBTTTIQ + community demands that the facts be investigated.

According to the first reports, the body of Alin, an activist for the rights of sexual diversity, was found inside an apartment in the Estación neighborhood, wrapped in a blanket.

"Unfortunately , hate crimes against our trans community are increasing , as we well know, the State of Mexico ranks second in transphobia crimes, it is one of the five most dangerous states for us," said Tanya Vázquez, president of Famous Trans Women of Toluca.

He recalled that Alin was part of the collective "Famosas Trans" and that his life was dedicated to making visible the problems they experience as part of the community of sexual and identity diversity.

"It is also inexcusable that the media, even after she is dead, find her reported with a name with which my sister never felt identified, we always knew her as Alin, my friend 'The butcher', our sister and it is annoying that, Even dead her identity is not respected, it is regrettable. The violence that we are experiencing must stop. "

Alin's companions indicated that they will continue to raise their voices not only for her but for all the victims of hate crimes in the State of Mexico.


At the moment, no detainees have been reported for the homicide that was already classified as a hate crime by the trans community of the Toluca Valley.

Data from the National Observatory of Hate Crimes, the murder of 41-year-old Alin is the third crime of this type in the Mexican state so far this year.

Members of the LGBTTTI + community pointed out the problems they face on a daily basis in the different sociocultural spaces and structures, they are due to prejudices and stigmas linked to their sexual orientation , expression or gender identity, despite the fact that the first article of the Magna Carta prohibits discrimination based on any personality characteristic.




The activist and transsexual woman Aline "N" was murdered in this municipality on Monday afternoon; At the moment no arrests.

According to preliminary police reports, the body was located inside the victim's apartment, located in the Ignacio Allende Extension of the La Estación neighborhood, in Mexicaltzingo.

The body apparently had a sharp weapon injury and was wrapped in a blanket, the reports detail.

Emergency services and public security elements cordoned off the area so that the victim's body could be lifted.

Alin "N", 41, was identified by her relatives. The victim was originally from the municipality of Mexicaltzingo and was recognized for his activism and participation in the movements of the LGBTTTIQ community.


LGBT + community, fighting for their rights
In this regard, Tania Vázquez, leader of the Humboldt Famosas, regretted what happened with her partner. He demanded that the Mexican Prosecutor's Office investigate what happened and detain those responsible, since apparently it is a hate crime. Meanwhile, on social media, members of the Toluca Valley transsexual community reproached what happened.

This case is added to others that have occurred in the entity. The last murder in the transsexual community occurred in 2018 with the case of Chanel, a member of Las Famosas de Humboldt.

Finally, Alin's murder occurred a few hours before the possible approval of the Gender Identity Law that is being discussed this Tuesday in the plenary session of the local Legislature.
