> Transgender woman Serenity Hollis murdered in Albany Ga
> May 14, 2021
> Transgender woman Serenity Hollis, 24, was shot and killed execution-style on May 8th at 4:00 am., while walking along West Highland Ave. in Albany Georgia. Albany police have repeatedly deadnamed and misgendered Serenity Hollis in media reports. However, the DA recently said ‘every indication’ pointed to her murder being a hate crime.
> 
> The APD has released a grainy video of the murder on Facebook but settings prohibit sharing it. It shows an individual approaching Serenity Hollis from behind and apparently shooting her in the back of her head. The perp then fled on foot. Planet trans zoomed into the three seconds before her murder. It appears that she was wearing a skirt and sensible heels.
> 
> “I don’t think it’s random. I believe honestly because of the way [she] carried [herself] that a lot of people took offense to it,” her sister Sara Osberry said. “So honestly I believe it was either a hate crime or an act of revenge for some reason.”
> 
> District Attorney Greg Edwards said the notion that this crime was a hate crime is because of “general circumstances”.
> 
> Edwards said many indicators are there.
> 
> “I cannot go into the specifics of everything about what happened, but it was pretty apparent that was probably a motivation for the death of Ms. Hollis,” said Edwards.
>
