Faced with this new murder act, the Magdalena Police Commander, Colonel Samir Pava Ávila reported that “we are making progress in collecting evidence, there are some very important interviews that are being evaluated together with the Prosecutor's Office, and we believe that in the next days they may be generating the corresponding arrest warrants to be able to impute the crime of homicide to the people who have been the material authors of this act ”.

It also transpired that, “the first hypothesis corresponds to an issue related to a difference that may have occurred with other people in the face of some events that occurred in previous years. That is what we are investigating with interviews with witnesses, material elements that have been collected and on that is that the entire structuring of the event is being based to be able with the Prosecutor's Office to materialize the arrest warrants, ”the colonel pointed out.

It is worth mentioning that the criminal action against 'Melibeth Yulitza' occurred on April 15 at 10:30 at night, in the back of the Los Laureles neighborhood on the corner of progreso [progress]. It was learned that the alleged assailants came to the victim's home and allegedly had a racy discussion with the victim, which ended up lying on the ground with two impacts produced with a firearm at the height of the face and neck. .

Subsequently, the aggressor left the home and after walking several meters he got on a motorcycle in which his accomplice was waiting for him, with whom he fled in a direction not established by the authorities. The subjects are being wanted by the authorities to answer for the crime.
