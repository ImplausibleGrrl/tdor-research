> On the cusp of the 2021 Trans Day of Remembrance (TDoR), Western Pennsylvania has lost a fourth trans person to the campaign of terror haunting the lives of our trans, nonbinary, and gendernonconforming neighbors.
> 
> Angel Naira, 36, was found dead from gunshot injuries in her Aliquippa home in Beaver County. Police responded to a 911 call seeking a welfare check for Angel.
> 
> “A female says a [person] is unresponsive. Not breathing. Said the apartment was broken into,” a 911 dispatcher said in audio obtained by KDKA. “The apartment was broken into. Some sort of disturbance there.”
> 
> Born in According to her brother, she worked for home health care full time, was a graduate from Aliquippa High School, and graduated from Beaver Falls Beauty Academy. Media reports – all misgendering and deadnaming her – report she was found with gunshot injuries. Online reports suggest she was physically beaten, but that’s unclear. Pennsylvania State Police are leading the investigations.
> 
> Once again, a victim’s loved ones have to add setting the record straight with media outlets and law enforcement who are universally reporting inaccurate information. There’s very little follow up reporting on her death, no information on the investigation, nothing. It is an almost deliberate erasure of Angel entirely. I expect so much more from Pittsburgh media.
> 
> Angel is the forty-seventh trans, nonbinary or gender nonconforming person reported killed in 2021. Forty-two of these neighbors have been BIPOC. She is the 32nd victim who identified as Black. 30 of these victims were under the age of 30. That we know of, as many deaths go unreported or unacknowledged. 2021 is now the most violent year on record for our trans neighbors in the United States, surpassing the previous total of 44 deaths in 2020.
> 
> Earlier this year, we lost two trans youth of color from nearby Ambridge, also in Beaver County. A few days prior, Chyna Carrillo was murdered in nearby New Brighton, Lawrence County. Pittsburgh has never been on this list since I began writing these posts in 2013, so skyrocketing to four deaths of trans BIPOC in one year is very difficult to understand.
> 
> In addition to the GoFundMe, SisTersPgh is contributing to the funeral expenses via the Aaliyah Johnson Fund.
> 
> Rest in power, Angel. Your friends and neighbors are pouring out their heartfelt grief over your death and sharing so many wonderful memories. You deserved the chance to create so many more memories. I am sorry that we failed you.
> 
> May your memory be a revolution.




> State police are investigating a shooting that left a man dead Thursday in Beaver County.
> 
> Brandon L. Murray, 36, of Aliquippa, was pronounced dead in his apartment in the 500 block of Linmar Terrace.
> 
> Aliquippa police were dispatched to the apartment shortly before 11 a.m. to check on Murray’s welfare. They discovered he’d been shot there, according to state police, who have taken over investigation of the case.
> 
> Anyone with information about the incident is asked to call state police at 727-773-7400.
