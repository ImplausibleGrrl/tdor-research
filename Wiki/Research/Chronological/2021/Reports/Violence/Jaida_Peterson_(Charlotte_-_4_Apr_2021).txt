Jaida Peterson, a 29-year-old Black transgender woman was killed on April 4, in Charlotte, N.C.

But due to police initially deadnaming and misgendering the victim we just learned of her death. The Charlotte Observer which first reported on Peterson’s murder recently updated their article and correctly identified the victim.

A phone call for a welfare check in west Charlotte turned into a homicide investigation, Charlotte-Mecklenburg police said.

Officers responded to the call around 1:45 p.m. Sunday at a hotel located in the 3100 block of Queen City Drive, near Interstate 85 and Billy Graham Parkway, CMPD said in a statement on Monday. Police found an unresponsive person in one of the rooms, CMPD said. Medic pronounced the person dead at the scene.

CMPD in a statement said the victim’s last name Peterson and the victim was 29-years-old.

Charlotte Uprising began fundraising last week for her family in South Carolina to hold a funeral. Jaida’s family has since said that they have raised enough money to pay for her funeral and want to thank everyone who gave.

The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department has ruled Jaida’s death a homicide, and asks anyone with information to contact 704-432-TIPS, or leave information anonymously with Crime Stoppers at 704-334-1600 or http://charlottecrimestoppers

Jaida Peterson is the second transgender person murdered In NC and the 34th death in the US since the 2020 TDoR.
