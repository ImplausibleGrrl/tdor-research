STATE OF MEXICO.â€” With half the body eaten away by wild fauna, the corpse of a man wearing women's clothing was found in a place in the community of San Luis Huexotla, in the municipality of Texcoco .

Municipal patrols who were making a tour of the area known as "La Siberia", in that town, discovered the silhouette of a person lying in the dry grass.

When the agents approached, they realized that the head and thorax of the victim had been eaten away by the fauna of the area. It was around 08:30 hours.

Although at first glance they thought it was a woman, about 27 years old, who had her feet tied with industrial tape, they later realized that it was a man.

The site was guarded by the police until experts from the Mexican Prosecutor's Office arrived, who - after collecting evidence - took the body to the regional morgue in Texcoco.

Due to the state in which he was found, the victim could not be identified, who was wearing jeans and a blue shirt, and had no footwear. The authorities are investigating the identity and if it was a transvestite, to try to find those responsible.
