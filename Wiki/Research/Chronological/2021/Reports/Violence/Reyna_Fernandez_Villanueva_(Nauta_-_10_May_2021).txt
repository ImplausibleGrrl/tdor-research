> THE "QUEEN" KILLED
> 
> Red Trans de Loreto, repudiates the murder of a transvestite in the city of Nauta. It classifies the savage act as a hate crime and orders the authorities that administer justice to punish the murderer, in the shortest possible time, with the full weight of the law. It also ensures that this murder confirms the intolerance of this society towards LGBTI populations.
> 
> At dawn on May 10, the murder of 27-year-old Rodrigo Álvaro Fernández Villanueva, known in trans society by the name of Reina, was reported. The act of blood occurred inside the company "Multiservicios Favicel", located in the La Casona shopping center, in the center of the city of Nauta.
> 
> The police authorities together with the representatives of the Public Ministry of the jurisdiction, showed that the body of the young trans woman was cruelly stabbed which led to her death.
> 
> Carol Carlobi Ríos - President of the Trans Network of Loreto, representing her organization, was outraged by the cruel murder of Reina for what she classifies as a hate crime. "... from the network after we want to express our total repudiation, we demand that the person or persons responsible for such a deplorable act be investigated in a free manner and punished.
> 
> Likewise, Carlobi did not hesitate to accuse that this murder could be a reflection of the type of society in which we live. "... one more trans death and this can attest once again to the hatred or cruelty towards trans people."
> 
> Finally, Carol urged the media to respect gender identity. "... Reina's death, at the hands of an intolerant murderer, also makes it clear to us that we are victims of femicide and the state does not want to see it as such." (Patrick López)

> 
> The police authorities, together with the representatives of the Public Ministry of the jurisdiction, evidenced that the body of the young woman was murdered with cruelty, so a hate crime is not ruled out.
> 
> Carlobi Ríos was outraged by Reina's death. "From the network after we want to express our total repudiation, we demand that the person or persons responsible for such a deplorable act be investigated in a celestial manner and punished," he told the newspaper Now.
> 
> Asimismo, la presidenta de la red no dudo en manifestar que este homicidio podría ser el reflejo del tipo de sociedad en la que vivimos. “Una muerte trans más. Esto puede dar fe, una vez más, del odio u ensañamiento hacia las personas trans”, aseveró.
> 
> “La muerte de Reina, en manos de un intolerante asesino, nos deja en claro también que somos víctimas de feminicidio y el Estado no lo quiere ver como tal”, concluyó Carol Carlobi.
> 
> ¿Dónde denunciar actos de violencia de género?
> Si usted ha sido o conoce a alguien que ha sido afectada o involucrada en hechos de violencia familiar o sexual, puede comunicarse de manera gratuita a la Línea 100 del Ministerio de la Mujer y Poblaciones Vulnerables, que cuenta con un equipo especializado en “brindar información, orientación y soporte emocional”.

> Además, la Línea 100 tiene la facultad de derivar los casos de violencia familiar o sexual más graves a los Centros de Emergencia Mujer o al Servicio de Atención Urgente. Este servicio atiende las 24 horas, todos los días del año (incluye feriados).
> 
> Remember that the Women's Emergency Centers (CEM) are also authorized to support members of the LGTBI community during any type of complaint. Likewise, the Ombudsman's Office is at the disposal of any citizen who experiences a case of LGTBphobia, either to gather information about their case or to accompany them throughout the complaint process.
