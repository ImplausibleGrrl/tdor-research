> On the same weekend ( September 26-27, 2021 ) Paulet was murdered in Guanajuato . She was a trans woman and was only 16 years old. Until the writing of this publication (September 28), only one medium has made their case known. By the way, the note denies her gender identity. This was one of the points made by activist Jazz Bustamante when publicizing the case.
