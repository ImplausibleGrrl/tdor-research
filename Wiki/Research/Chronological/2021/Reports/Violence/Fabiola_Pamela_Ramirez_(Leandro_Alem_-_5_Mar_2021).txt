A 22-year-old transgender girl was found dead in her home in the southern part of Resistencia. The body found had an advanced state of decomposition and that is why forensic tests will be carried out to determine the cause of death. So far, the main hypothesis points to a homicide.

As reported by the police, after 3:45 p.m., staff from the Fifth Metropolitan Commissioner learned from the residents of the General Rawson neighborhood that a house located on Alem Street emanated a strong nauseating odor.

In this way, they went to the place and found Fabiola dead. They immediately reported the situation to the prosecutor, who ordered the intervention of the Scientific Cabinet of the judiciary, who carried out a rigorous inspection of the place and found stains similar to blood, collecting these items of evidence to be subjected to expert tests.

Once the diligence was completed, the body was transferred to the IMCIF, for the corresponding autopsy, initiating for the moment a judicial case as "Doubtful Death".

On the other hand, personnel from the Crimes Against Persons Division under the Complex Investigations Department and personnel from the external service of Commissioner Quinta Resisencia took part, who are at the disposal of the prosecutor.

 
A 22-year-old trans woman was found dead in a home located in Leandro Alem at approximately 1800. 

This afternoon, staff from the Fifth Metropolitan Police Station were informed by residents of the General Rawson neighborhood that a house in the area gave off strong repulsive odors.

For this reason, the troops went to the place and found Fabiola Pamela Ramírez dead. They immediately reported the situation to the prosecutor on duty, who ordered the intervention of the Scientific Cabinet belonging to the Judiciary.

They carried out an inspection of the place and found blood stains, an element that was collected as evidence to carry out the corresponding tests.

Once the procedure was completed, the body was transferred to the IMCIF to carry out the autopsy. So far, the court case has been labeled "Doubtful Death."
