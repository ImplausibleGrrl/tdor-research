> Three trans women were murdered in a single day
> They were finished on the day of candles in Santa Marta, Rioacha and Bogotá. Authorities offer $ 80 million for information.
> The murder of the leader of Santa Marta Cristina Cantillo shook the inhabitants of Magdalena not only because of her recognized social work defending the rights of the LGTBIQ + community and the restitution of land, but because the crime may be related to her sexual identity as a trans woman.
> 
> In different cities and times, but on the same date of the day of candles (December 7), two other trans women were murdered: 'La Divaza' (Yusman Gabriel Dávila), as she was known in Rioacha, and 'Maní', who was assassinated in Bogotá. Both bled to death after receiving fatal stab wounds from their attackers.
> 
> With their deaths, and according to the records of the database of the Trans Community Network of Colombia (RCT), 35 transsexual women who have been murdered so far this year are completed.
> 
> “This is systematic. We are seeing a direct relationship between exclusion and the crime of being killed. For example, these last three who killed weren't just trans women. Cristina was a community leader, La Divaza was a street dweller and Maní was an Afro and a sex worker ”, described Matilda González, a lawyer for the RCT, in dialogue with EL COLOMBIANO.
> 
> A silenced leader
> 
> In the specific case of the leader Cristina Cantillo, it was clear that she faced a high risk of being assassinated. Only in 2020 suffered two attacks with a firearm. In fact, the National Protection Unit had assigned her a security scheme during the day, but at night she was left vulnerable and was killed by armed men who shot her at the door of her house.
> 
> Faced with the events, dozens of social and political leaders lamented the death and called for prompt action by the authorities, including the governor of Magdalena, Carlos Caicedo.
> 
> According to him, Colonel Jesús de los Reyes, commander of the Santa Marta Police, failed in managing the security of the leader, for which I have requested that she be relieved.
> 
> With the intention of finding those responsible, the Mayor's Office and the Governor's Office offered 80 million pesos.
> 
> And the authorities?
> 
> Although the Prosecutor's Office does not have a concrete figure of how many cases it investigates or how many trans women have been murdered in the last two years - as he told this newspaper - what is known is that, according to its records, 40 have been presented. homicides against members of the LGTBI community in general, which includes lesbian, gay and bisexual people, among others.
> 
> Despite this, data from the Prosecutor's Office indicate that between 2020 and the first nine months of 2021 there have been 11 convictions related to homicides and attempted homicides against trans women.
> 
> However, the groups continue to denounce multiple barriers to accessing justice.
> 
> In fact, the RCT and some other organizations have been denouncing the case of a man who, allegedly, is systematically murdering trans women.
> 
> As one of them denounced, "the man uses the same modus operandi and makes alleged strangers to his victims, as if he were used to doing so." Said case has already been formally reported to the Prosecutor's Office and is under investigation, "but it is moving slowly"
> 
> And it is that, according to the experience of lawyer González, “for trans people it is still very difficult to access the legal system. With one of the cases that we have, they left us seven hours waiting to carry out an exam, we deliver tests and the cases do not progress (...) the officials are not able to look them in the eye and they continue to speak to them in masculine terms ”, he concluded Gonzalez.





> Yesterday they killed 3 trans women, two of them black women. Maní was a sex worker in Bogotá, La Diva was a street resident in Riohacha, and Cristina was a human rights defender in Santa Marta.
