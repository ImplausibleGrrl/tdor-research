> Death of trans man in Camaçari is related to hate crime, friend says
> Victim was preparing to start the transition process

> 
> A biomedical student, Camury Rosa de Jesus Amorim was 20 years old and a transsexual man. He had no problem talking about the subject and was getting ready to start the gender transition process. There was no time. He was shot dead by three hooded men at dawn on Wednesday (15) in Camaçari, in the Metropolitan Region of Salvador. 
> 
> The Civil Police has not yet formalized a line of investigation, but close friends attribute the murder of the young man to transphobia. The victim was buried in the city of RMS, this Thursday morning (16). 
> 
> Rosa had lived alone for a few months in Camaçari, had left Brotas, in the capital, due to the violence he suffered for always showing himself, remembers the journalism student Anne Almeida, 30, a friend of the victim. She says that Camury drew attention for her beauty and personality, which may have aroused disaffection.
> 
> "He was an amazing person, but he was under constant attack for being who he was. He was close to starting the transition, he was a very committed person. I really believe in 'homophobia'," says Anne, describing the friend as an independent and hardworking person, even with a "financially stabilized family".
> 
> Anne learned of the death through virtual means and says that the news immediately shocked the entire network of friends. "Because he was a person who wasn't in trouble. He read too much, too smart." The victim had a good relationship with the family, but living alone was always an option.
> 
> Camury was single and, according to Anne, some people raised the hypothesis that he had a relationship with a committed woman - which presents itself, for now, as a remote possibility. As well as the rumors that a drug debt would have motivated the crime, says the student. 
> 
> Although she sees evidence in the crime that refer to the way traffickers usually carry out disaffections, Anne does not abandon the conviction that her friend died for reasons related to gender. "I doubt it very much, it has nothing to do with her. She had no involvement in this trafficking thing."
> 
> While the reasons are uncertain, she waits for investigations to reveal what really caused the death of her friend, whose last memory is of the "good energies" shared at Poesia beach, on an afternoon in Itapuã.


> The trans man, identified as Camury Rosa de Jesus Amorim, 20, was shot dead on Wednesday (15th). Hooded men broke into his house in the Gravatá neighborhood in Camaçari and shot him. The information is from the Civil Police. 
> 
> Camury did not resist his injuries and died in the residence, located on Rua Venus II. The case is being investigated by the 18th Police Station (Camaçari).
