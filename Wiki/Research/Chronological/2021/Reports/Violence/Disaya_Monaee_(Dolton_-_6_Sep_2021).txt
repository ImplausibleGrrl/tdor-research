> CHICAGO, IL The National Black Justice Coalition (NBJC) mourns the death of Disaya Monaee Smith, a Black transgender woman from Chicago, Illinois. Disaya Monaee Smith’s death was initially reported by Beverly Ross on Instagram. Ross reported that Disaya Monaee Smith died on September 6th in Dolton, IL. 
> 
> “We mourn the loss of Disaya Monaee Smith,” explained NBJC Deputy Executive Director Victoria Kirby York. “2021 is on track to be the deadliest year on record for transgender and non-binary people – and in Chicago, Disaya Monaee Smith’s killing marks the fourth transgender person to be murdered in the Chicago region this year alone. Illinois, Dolton, and county police departments must do more to proactively prevent the continued loss of trans lives happening across their city.”
> 
> Disaya Monaee Smith is one of 36 transgender or non-binary people to be killed in 2021, that we know of. She was the fourth transgender person killed in the Chicago region this year. 2021 is expected to surpass 2020 for the most trans people killed in one year. This year has also seen more than 120 anti-trans bills introduced across the country in state legislatures which may be an influence in the increase of the number of homicides, domestic murders, and hate crimes targeting transgender women.


> Yesterday Another Blaxk Trans Woman was killed- her name is Disaya / Dior - This is the 4th Trans Woman murdered here in Chicago this year.
