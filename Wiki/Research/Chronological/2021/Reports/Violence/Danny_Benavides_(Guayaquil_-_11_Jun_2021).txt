They denounce alleged murder by blows of a trans woman in Ecuador
June 14, 2021 - 16:02
Quito, Jun 14 (EFE) .- The Silhouette X association denounced this Monday an alleged murder by blows of a trans woman at her home in the coastal city of Guayaquil (southwest).

The Psycho Trans Center of the Silhouette X Association - members of the National Platform for Trans Revolution and the National Federation of LGBT Organizations - indicated in a statement that the fact was known last Friday.

That day, in the sector known as Monte Sinaí, located in the north of Guayaquil, "the lifeless body of Danny Benavides was found, which was picked up by criminalistics personnel who performed the rigorous tests," he said.

"(In these examinations) it can be determined that Danny died from a cranioencephalic hematoma. His body was found with several blows to both the skull and the rest of his body for which it is presumed that prior to his death he was tortured", I notice.

Likewise, he added, "she was found locked in her house with a padlock when the criminalistics staff arrived."

According to the Association, friends, relatives and close friends of the victim seek clarification of the facts "since from what is known he had no problems with anyone to lose his life in a cruel and criminal act."

"Danny dies in a state of indigence. We have also learned unofficially that the Police personnel are asking for a reward for the cell phone owned by the murdered colleague," considered a key element in the investigation of the event, he says in a statement .

The Association asked the Secretariat for Human Rights to hold an inter-institutional table that includes the Office of the Prosecutor, National Police and the Council of the Judiciary, among other institutions, to allow an impartial investigation to find those responsible for the incident.

The Runa Sipiy Report, from the Silhouette X Association, records five murders so far this 2021 against LGBTIQ + populations. EFE
