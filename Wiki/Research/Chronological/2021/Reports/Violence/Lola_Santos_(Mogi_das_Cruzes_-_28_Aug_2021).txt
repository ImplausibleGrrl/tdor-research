According to information from the State Department of Public Security (SSP), "policemen were called by the victim's neighbors after they smelled a bad smell coming from inside her apartment." The case is treated as a homicide.
> 
> As the report found out, Lola was a hairdresser, but was unemployed, receiving help from the federal government. The note sent by the SSP to O Diário shows that, "when they entered the place, the MPs found the body in a state of putrefaction and the house was searched", and that "the Homicide and Protection of Persons Department (SHPP) and the expertise were triggered and images from security cameras collected for analysis".
> 
> According to the website Police in QAP, the Department of Homicide and Protection of Persons (SHPP) is already looking for clues to solve the crime. The Diário tried to contact the SHPP, but did not get a response until the publication of this report. The case was registered as a homicide on duty in Mogi das Cruzes.
> 
> On the internet, many people and groups have been speaking out about the death of Lola, which resembles the case of Nataly Lily, also a transsexual, who was reported missing in December 2020, in an “architected” crime.
