> Alireza Fazeli Monfared, a 20-year-old from Ahvaz, Khuzestan province, was murdered on May 4 for identifying as non-binary and gay. Following the hate crime, Amnesty International called on Tehran to hold those responsible for the murder accountable, and to end the criminalization of the community. 
> 
> “The organization is renewing its calls on the Iranian authorities to repeal laws which criminalize consensual same-sex relations in Iran, including through the application of the death penalty and flogging, and which ban clothing, hairstyles, and other forms of gender expression that do not conform to strict binary gender ‘norms’ enforced by the establishment,” read a statement from the rights watchdog.
> 
> “Amnesty International reiterates its serious concerns that these laws legitimize and act as official incitement to or justification for systematic discrimination and violence against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) individuals in Iran, including in state custody, on the street, at school and workplace or in the home,” it added.
> 
> In a January report, the watchdog “urged Iran to free an Iranian LGBTIQ+ activist held for the last three months on charges linked to an appearance in a documentary on gay rights in Iraqi Kurdistan.”

> The Iranian authorities must promptly conduct an independent, impartial and effective criminal investigation into the murder of 20-year-old Alireza Fazeli Monfared, who self-identified as a non-binary gay man and bring those responsible to account in fair trials and without recourse to the death penalty. Investigations must examine whether the crime was motivated by hostility and prejudice on the grounds of his gender identity and sexual orientation. Marking the International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia, Intersex-phobia and Transphobia, Amnesty International is renewing its calls on the Iranian authorities to repeal laws which criminalize consensual same-sex relations in Iran, including through the application of the death penalty and flogging.
