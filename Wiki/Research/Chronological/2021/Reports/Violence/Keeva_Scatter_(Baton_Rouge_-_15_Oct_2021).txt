Baton Rouge Police Department is investigating a murder of a Black woman of trans experience, that was found dead in the 4100 block of W. Brookstown Dr. near Prescott Rd. in a grassy field.

On October 15th around 10:50pm Baton Rouge Police Department arrived on scene to find 34 year old Keeva Scatter a Black woman of trans experience, dead due to a gunshot wound in the 4100 block of W. Brookstown Dr. near Prescott Rd. in a grassy field.


Presently police have no leads and are investigating this murder.

We at TransGriot and within the trans community are asking that anyone with information to please contact the Violent Crimes Unit at 389-4869 or Crime Stoppers at 344-7867.

Keeva is presently listed as the 42nd murder but sadly this number isn’t accurate as far to often the media and law enforcement get it wrong with the misgendering “Man in womens clothes” or “Woman shot multiple times” this has to stop! Keeva’s murder follows the reported murder of Royal Poetical Starz but as of date this murder follows that of Mel Robert Groves. Sadly just like the media outlets got it wrong by misgendering Keeva both Royal and Mel experienced the same causing them to go under the radar when they initially happened and were reported.

It’s so sad that media continues to get it wrong when it comes to the murders of Trans folxs. Sadly in Baton Rouge they’re still getting it wrong with headlines like “Man shot to death on West Brookstown Drive, BRPD investigating” 

To the family and loved ones of Keeva know that her name will be said, she will be honored and we will support in any way that we can to get #JusticeForKeeva if you’re looking for an updated list we suggest you follow HRC and visit the list on their site.
