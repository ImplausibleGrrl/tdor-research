Affirmative Caribbean Rejection

This is the first case of violent death registered in the department of Cesar, which raises concern since violence against members of the LGBTI community does not stop.

 “Trans women are subjected to circles of poverty, in which the active subjects of behaviors are based on negative imaginations that make them believe that violence should be exercised on their bodies to eliminate the difference. Trans women are those who have less access to fundamental rights and affirmative actions, such as: projects, programs and public policies, since these do not have this population group as a priority, ”says the statement from the Affirmative Caribbean Human Rights Observatory.

It also states that, “repeatedly, a call is made to the Office of the Attorney General of the Nation to carry out a thorough and effective investigative procedure that guarantees the application of a differential approach based on the gender identity of the victim, which will clarify if this case is a femicide. In the same way, objectivity is requested in the analysis of the facts, in order not to incur in re-victimization and criminalization of the sexual practices and the victim itself ”.

In turn, they reiterated to the authorities the corresponding protections, non-stigmatization and guarantees for those who perform sex work.
