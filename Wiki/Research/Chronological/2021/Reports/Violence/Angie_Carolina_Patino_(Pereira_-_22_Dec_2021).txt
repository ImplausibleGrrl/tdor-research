> "From the Governor's Office we very much regret this situation and this invites us to continue generating forceful actions to ensure them, implement shelter houses, improve options in labor matters and, together with authorities, protection measures. We are making progress on several issues, but we know that there is much to do and that this process is just beginning, "said José Giraldo, LGBTI departmental liaison for the department of Risaralda.
