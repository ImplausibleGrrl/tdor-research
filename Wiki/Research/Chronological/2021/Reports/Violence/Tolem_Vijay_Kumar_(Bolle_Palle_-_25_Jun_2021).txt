Mulugu: Man hacks transgender over sorcery scare
By Telangana Today  |  Published: 25th Jun 2021  8:12 pm
Mulugu: In a shocking incident, a transgender was axed to death on suspicion that he was practicing sorcery at Bollepally hamlet and Bandhala village of SS Tadvai mandal in the district on Thursday night.

The deceased was identified as Tolem Vijay Kumar (25). The maternal aunt of the deceased Punem Sarakka alleged that Punem Suresh from the same village attacked Vijay with an axe and killed him, suspecting that his sister, Neelaveni, committed suicide six months ago due to sorcery by Vijay.

“Vijay was dragged out of the house and attacked with an axe by Suresh. He died on the spot due to profuse bleeding,” she said.

Based on a complaint by Sarakka, police visited the spot and shifted the body for autopsy besides launching investigation by registering a case. Pasra CI Anumula Srinivas and Tadvai SI Ch Venkateshwar Rao visited the spot on Friday.
