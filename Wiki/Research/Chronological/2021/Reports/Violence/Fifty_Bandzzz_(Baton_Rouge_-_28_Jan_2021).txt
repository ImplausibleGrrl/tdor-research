shot



Fifty was shot by her boyfriend - a man described by witnesses as "very volatile" and who they said "was not open or forthcoming" about dating her.

> After a transgender woman was found dead from gunshot wounds last week, detectives with the Baton Rouge Police Department identified a suspect: a man with whom she was in a relationship who had threatened her life in the past.
> 
> Police said he pulled the trigger during an argument.
> 
> Michael Joshua Brooks, 20, was booked into jail Tuesday morning, five days after [deadname] Wyatt was shot to death. The shooting occurred in the 5000 block of McClelland Drive, part of Baton Rouge's Brookstown neighborhood.
> 
> Detectives interviewed several witnesses to solve the case. During the interviews, they learned that Wyatt — who friends called 'Fifty' — was a transgender woman and had been involved in a relationship with Brooks for over a year, according to his arrest warrant.
> 
> Witnesses described the relationship as "very volatile" and said Brooks "was not open or forthcoming" about dating the victim, which "had caused personal problems" for them, detectives wrote in the warrant. At some point over the summer, Wyatt posted videos of them together, according to the warrant. Witnesses said Brooks had threatened to kill her in the past.
