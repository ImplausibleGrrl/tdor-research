On the first floor of a building in the area, the victim was found lying on a plastic mat and bleeding from the mouth. The victim was identified as 60-year-old Shafiq.

On inspection of the body, no external injury was found. The body was shifted to GTB Hospital and declared brought dead. The post-mortem report revealed the possibility of a murder.

In their investigation, the police also went through the call records of the victim and some other individuals. Through this, they were able to identify the whereabouts of the involved people.

TWO ARRESTED
On July 17, the police team arrested two accused named Rashid and Yoginder from Amroha district in Uttar Pradesh. Two mobile phones used in the commission of the offence were recovered from the accused.

The two disclosed that they had been employed by the main conspirator Farid, a resident of Seemapuri, to carry out the murder for a sum of Rs 2 lakh. Farid is the brother of Rashid, who has already been arrested.

According to the account of the accused, Farid had taken a ‘friendly’ loan of Rs 10 lakh from the victim. He conspired to kill Shafiq after the latter mounted pressure on him to pay his long-standing dues.

MODUS OPERANDI
On the night of the murder, Rashid and Yogender along with one Naushad, who is absconding at present, went to Shafiq’s residence. While Rashid waited outside to keep watch, the other two entered the house and introduced themselves as court Munshis. They deceived the victim by saying that an advocate would come the next morning to settle the dues and they would stay there till then.

Shafiq then offered the Yogender and Naushad food. All three ate their meal and slept. At midnight, the two accused allegedly woke up and went to the terrace to ready an injection. They then came down, put a pillow over Shafiq’s mouth and smothered him. They also injected a poisonous solution in the victim’s neck and strangulated him with a towel when he became unconscious.

After committing the murder, they all escaped along with the mobile phone of the victim.

As of now, main conspirator Farid and other accused Naushad are still at large. Police teams are being sent out to nab them.
