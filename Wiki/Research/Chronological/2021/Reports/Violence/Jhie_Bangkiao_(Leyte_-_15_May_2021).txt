> 
> Three days after going missing, Ebeng Mayor, a non-binary trans person, was found dead, bloodied, and bruised, with a wooden stick impaled in their genitals. It was believed that they were raped before being killed. Another victim, transgender woman Jhie Bangkiao, was found naked with a bloodied head in a cemetery.
> 
> Both members of the transgender community were found brutally murdered, a few days after the celebration of International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia, Interphobia, and Transphobia
> 
> These brutal murders are not just a loss of lifeâ€“ these are also crimes fueled by hate. This goes to show that the passage of the SOGIE Equality Bill is urgent. What transpired is a clear manifestation that the LGBT+ community is not safe in the country. This is not the first case of aggression and harassment towards the LGBT+ community. It is high time for the state to recognize that these are not isolated cases, rather attacks that are based on the SOGIE of the victims. We have been a target of harassment in society for a long time, and this will go on as long as perpetrators are not held accountable, and as long as the culture of violence and transphobia exists in the Philippines.
> 
> Bahaghari-UP Baguio Chapter expresses our deepest condolences to the families of the victims. We are one with the clamor for justice. Furthermore, we call on the authorities to conduct a full investigation regarding the cases of Ebeng and Junjie, and to hold those involved accountable. We also call on the government to pass the SOGIE Equality Bill immediately. The passage of the bill is set to make the country a safer space for the LGBT+ community as it ensures that crimes against the LGBT+ are held accountable.
