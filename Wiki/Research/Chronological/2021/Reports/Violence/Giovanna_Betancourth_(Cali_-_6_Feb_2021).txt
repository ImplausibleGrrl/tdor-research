Violence against people with trans life experiences does not stop in Colombia. This Saturday, Santamaría Fundación, an organization that works to defend the rights of this population, denounced the murder of Giovanna Betancourth, a trans woman from Cali.

"How much pain there is in our struggle. Today we woke up with the sad news of the loss, due to violent acts, of a sister, partner, friend "They wrote on the Facebook account of that organization.

EL TIEMPO contacted Santamaría Fundación, from where they stated: "At the moment, we have not received official information about the situation or the causes of this transfemicide. We are attentive to what the Police and the Prosecutor's Office say."

Giovanna was a trans woman who dreamed of being a beautician and had trained in a beauty academy.

"She made her way with tenacity, like all of us," representatives of the Santamaría Fundación told this newspaper. And they added: "through this job possibility, she wanted to stop practicing sex work, since she considered it very dangerous, analysis she endured based on her experience and that of many of her friends. "

From that organization they described the murder as" a brutal act of transfemicide. "



Third murder in 2021
Giovanna's is the third known case this year of a person with trans life experience murdered in Colombia.

The first, as reported by this newspaper, was recorded on Saturday, January 2, when  Samantha, a woman after working as a stylist in Mariquita, Tolima, was attacked by armed men who were mobilizing on a motorcycle and fled the place without being identified. .

And the second, in the Tintala neighborhood, in Bogotá. The body of Verónica Solano, a trans woman, was found dead and with several stab wounds .

(Also:  A trans woman was murdered in the Tintala neighborhood, in Bogotá )

According to a count advanced by the Trans Community Network, another organization that works for the rights of the trans population in Colombia, in 2020 32 cases of trans people murdered in the country were documented.

At first, 31 were known, but in January that organization reported another case that occurred on December 30 in Ipiales, Nariño . The victim's name was Erika and, it was reported, "was beaten, stabbed in the neck and there was sexual violence."

However, several organizations have warned that there is an underreporting and that the number of trans people killed because of their gender identity is surely higher.
