> Martina Caldera was found dead on Dec. 6 on the I-10 overpass on East Freeway at Sheldon Road in Channelview. Harris County said she was shot several times by a unknown suspect, and are still investigating her death. 
> Family members of Martina Caldera, a 38-year old transgender woman, are heartbroken and want answers following the death of their loved one in December. 
> 
> "We're torn apart. It’s hard on us because we also lost my father to COVID and now this," said Noel Caldera, Martina's older brother. "It’s been a rough couple of years for our family."
> 
> Martina, of Baytown, was found dead on Dec. 6 near an overpass on the East Freeway at Sheldon Road in Channelview.
> 
> Upon arrival, deputies initially believed her death was the result of a motor vehicle accident, the Harris County Sheriff's Office said in a release. However, investigators with the vehicular crime division determined that Martina was shot several times. 
> 
> Her brother Noel, who went to the scene and barely recalls seeing any droplets of blood, believes she was shot somewhere else and dumped there. 
> 
> "I think somebody pulled [her] out of the car and pulled off," Caldera said to the Chronicle. 
> 
> Caldera said everyone in their large family accepted Martina as a transgender woman, but he personally still calls her his brother. 
> 
> He believes her gender identity ultimately contributed to her death. 
> 
> "[She] was very proud to be transgender," Caldera said.  "[She] just wanted to be accepted and [she] felt like no one accepted [her] because [she] was transgender."
> 
> OnHoustonChronicle.com: Texas GOP candidate Shelley Luther complains that students can’t make fun of transgender children
> 
> Caldera said he wants Martina to be remembered as a beautiful person who he described as very loving and thoughtful, always wanting to be with family and offering to help when needed. 
> 
> "[She] would call my mother every day. [She] would call family members in the middle of the night just to say I love you," Caldera said of Martina. "We have over 40 nieces and nephews and [she] knew everyone’s birthday by heart. [She] would just go to the parks and try to clean up after people. [She] would just show up to any one of my sister’s houses and start cleaning and washing dishes. 'Hey what can I do to help?' [She] would get the kids and take them to the park. [She] would walk my kids home from school to make sure they were safe."
> 
> And as the baby of 10 siblings, Caldera said Martina was always the designated babysitter, but truly wanted one of her own.
> 
> "That’s something that I want to kind of do before I turn 40. I’ve really been thinking about it, like having one naturally with a female. Or I could donate to a couple. But I really want my own," Martina said in a Nov. 2021 feature in The Baytown Project.
> 
> “Either way, it’s going to hurt because my dad met all his grandchildren. And if I have a child, he wouldn’t be able to meet him or her." 
> 
> Caldera said their family recently revisited the area where Martina was found dead, playing some of Martina's favorite songs and holding signs.
> 
> Deputies are still investigating Martina's death and do not have a suspect. They are urging anyone with information to contact the Harris County Sheriff's Office Homicide Unit at (713) 274-9100 or Crime Stoppers at (713) 222 TIPS (8477).
