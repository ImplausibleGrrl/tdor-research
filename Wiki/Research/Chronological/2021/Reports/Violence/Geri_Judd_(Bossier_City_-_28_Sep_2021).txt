> 
> Jasmine Anderson-Brownlee still has a bullet in her back from the shooting that almost made her another transgender woman killed in Shreveport.
> 
> In 2006, she was six years into being a sex worker on Pierre Ave when she was shot at 3 a.m. She worked that gig from 18 years old to 29 years old. On good nights, she could earn $900. She continued to do it for five years after she was shot.
> 
> "I was in a wheelchair for three months and my best friend would push me up here every night," Anderson-Brownlee said about the months following her shooting while standing on Pierre 16 years later. “Those are the stepping stones to me being who I am today.” 
> 
> After the shooting death of a younger transgender woman she knew, Anderson-Brownlee founded Trans Lives Matter Shreveport, through which she unites local transgender people and advocates for those who weren't as lucky as she to survive their attacks. 
> 
> “Violence against trans women is real. They want to erase us in the most brutal way possible,” Anderson-Brownlee said. “There’s a lot of people in the world who hate us. There are a lot of people who want our demise. This is a fight we have to fight alone.”
> 
> Murders of transgender people in the United States hit a record high in 2021. According to the Human Rights Campaign, the leading organization reporting violence against transgender people, at least 55 transgender people were murdered in the nation last year, up from 44 in 2020.
> 
> In the Shreveport-Bossier City area, three transgender women were killed in the year between Oct. 2020 and Oct. 2021: 20-year-old Brooklyn DeShauna Smith was found shot dead in her apartment in Oct. 2020 in Shreveport, 25-year-old Pooh Johnson was found shot dead in her car in August 2021 in Shreveport, and Geri Judd was found shot dead inside her home in Sept. 2021 in Bossier City.
> 
> No one has been charged in their murders.
> 
> During that same time period, Chicago had the most murders of transgender women of any U.S. city with five, followed by Miami where there were four, and Dallas where there were three. 
> 
> Anderson-Brownlee met Smith through family connections, and they would see each other at social gatherings and parties as Smith grew older.
> 
> “Every time she would come around, she just wanted to dance against me,” Anderson-Brownlee remembers of Smith.
> 
> Because many transgender homicides are either partially or inaccurately reported by the media and police departments, the annual numbers are thought to be higher. 
> 
> HRC’s numbers show that 55 transgender murders in 2021 took place in 24 states. Neighboring Texas had the highest total with seven.   Louisiana led the nation with 13 transgender homicides in a stretch from January 2013 to August 2018.
> 
> The HRC's year-end total did not account for Judd's homicide.    
> 
> As is common nationwide, most of the victims are black transgender women. The sole exception in this article is Judd, who was white.
> 
> “Many people are victimized and they don’t get the justice they deserve because people tend to let personal biases overshadow the actual crime and that comes from biases from people who are not tolerable enough to understand everyone deserves to be secure and safe,” said former Shreveport Police Department homicide detective Rodney Demery. 
> 
> Since retiring from the Shreveport Police Department, Demery has produced a series for the Investigation Discovery channel called Murder Chose Me where he discusses some of his most high profile cases while a re-enactment of the case is dramatized.
> 
> "The one thing I’ve come to realize is that people who live in marginalized communities there tends to be violence against them and in a sense there is really no outrage," Demery said.
> 
> Smith’s murder has been a major motivation for Trans Lives Matter Shreveport. Anderson-Brownlee said the organization gave away 90 bicycles to local children last winter. Local advocate Michael 
> 
> Chisum said Smith’s murder energized LGBTQ+ advocacy in the area. 
> 
> “When we had Brooklyn’s memorial and her family showed up fighting for justice, that changed the dynamic of the city because we hadn’t had that before,” Chisum said.
> 
> Smith’s mother LaRhonda Smith said her daughter was her best friend. She described her as a hyper child who loved to do nails and hair for family and said Brooklyn came out as transgender at age 13.
> 
> “Making people laugh was her hobby; she was very sarcastic in a good way,” Smith said of her daughter.
> 
> She said Brooklyn lived at King’s Manor Apartments. The mother always thought the complex was unsafe. Smith said her daughter’s body was inside the apartment for two days before it was discovered and said the detectives suspect Brooklyn allowed the perpetrator inside.
> 
> “They took something away from me that I don’t understand and I want to know what did my baby do that bad to make them do what they did? You took away a person who loved their family, mom, sisters, her brothers, her nieces, her nephews - they took away my light. They destroyed me with this one,” Smith said.
> 
> Chisum was eight years old when he met Judd at his childhood church in Bossier City. He said Judd was nearing high school graduation at the time, so they grew familiar with each other's families before their paths later crossed in adulthood. They'd dress up and go eat in downtown Shreveport together as well as attend annual memorials on Trans Day of Remembrance.
> Chisum last saw Judd when delivering groceries to her, as he'd regularly do.
> 
> "Geri was one of the first trans people I had met," Chisum said. "Jeri had done all the work and followed all the legal steps to transition including paperwork and ID."
> Chisum said Judd walked on a cane to participate in a 2020 march for justice for Vontashia Bell, a black transgender woman who was killed in 2018. Her killer hasn't been caught either. 
> 
> “There was video in evidence of an altercation that happened the night before Vontashia was murdered and in that video were a handful of people I knew from around town. They just let her be bullied and I thought I don’t want to be one of those people," Chisum said.
> 
> Chisum and Anderson-Brownlee believe the common fate of homelessness amongst transgender people leaves them susceptible to violence.
> 
> "Trans women being homeless is why they turn to prostitution and prostitution is how they get murdered. It’s a cycle," Anderson-Brownlee said, adding that many guns were brandished at her during her former career.
> 
> Anderson-Brownlee also spreads awareness for Trans Lives Matter through her music, recording songs titled "The Movement" and "Working Girl" under the name Da Queen of Da South.
