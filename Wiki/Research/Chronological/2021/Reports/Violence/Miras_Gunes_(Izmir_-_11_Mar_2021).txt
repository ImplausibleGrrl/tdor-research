Miraş Güneş was found wrapped in a blanket on a sofa bed in her home in İzmir (Turkey) on 11 Mar 2021. Investigators determined that she died from blunt force trauma to the head.

She was 36.



It was learned that a transgender person, whose body was found wrapped in a blanket, was killed by hitting the head with a hard object in the Bornova district of Izmir.

When the bad odors began to emanate from the apartment of the transgender person who used the name 'Miras Günes', who had not been heard from him for a while and who was filed for disappearance by his relatives, the residents of the building reported the situation to their relatives. 

It was determined that Yüksel lost his life after the checks made by the healthcare teams upon the notification.

While it was learned that Yüksel was killed by being hit with a hard object on his head , crime scene investigation teams made examinations inside the house. After the prosecutor's investigations, Yüksel's lifeless body was taken to the morgue of the Izmir Forensic Medicine Institute for autopsy.


The case occurred at night in Rafet Pasa Neighborhood. According to the allegation, a relative who came to the residence where transgender Kadir Yüksel was found found Yüksel wrapped in a blanket in the sofa bed at home.

Suspecting Yüksel's situation, his relative reported the case to the police and healthcare teams. It was determined that Yüksel had lost his life after the checks carried out by the healthcare teams that came upon notice.

On the other hand, while the crime scene investigation teams were conducting investigations inside the house, Yüksel's lifeless body was taken to the morgue of the Izmir Forensic Medicine Institute to determine the exact cause of death after the prosecutor's investigations. An investigation was launched on the suspicion of a massacre.
