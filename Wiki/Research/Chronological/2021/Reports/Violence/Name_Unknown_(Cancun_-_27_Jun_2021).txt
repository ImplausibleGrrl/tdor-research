murdered


> CANCÚN.- The lifeless body found bagged yesterday, behind the old General Hospital, in Supermanzana 65 of this city, corresponds to a transsexual person, and not to a [cisgender] woman as initially thought.
> 
> The body of this victim, with several burn marks on their back, was found inside a garbage bag, on calle 22, near the “El Crucero” area.
> 
> The case is still being investigated as femicide, since it is suspected that the victim was murdered for gender reasons, so the Special Prosecutor's Office in this crime maintains the case.
> 
> The burns found on this body date back to the murder of a homosexual man earlier this month, who was beaten and killed.
> 
> The State Attorney General's Office announced in recent weeks the arrest of the alleged perpetrator of this murder, captured in Tabasco.
