She was also engaged in sex work, reported Venus Nolasco, president of the Perla de Oriente Collective. “She was attacked from behind, there is no indication of the perpetrators. She asked for help and was taken to the hospital but she died because she drowned with her own blood, ”the activist told Presentes.
> 
> Zashy was part of the Perla de Oriente Collective. The organization works to promote the rights of the LGBTI population in the eastern part of the country. Among their programs they have designed emergency routes to deal with reports of attacks.
> 
> According to other sources who asked not to be identified for security reasons, Zashy had also received threats. It is suspected that they came from one of the groups that is part of the Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) gang, an organization that operates in the area. The gangs in El Salvador have an intolerant macho structure towards diverse populations, causing forced displacement in the territories they control, extortion and assassinations.

> 
> Between 2016 and 2017, three trans women have been murdered in the city of San Miguel, according to LGBTI rights defense organizations. "They have killed several comrades and the crimes have remained like this, unpunished," Venus denounced.
> 
> The study “ Prejudice knows no borders ”, presented by the Observatory Without LGBTI Violence, identified that Saturdays and Sundays are when more crimes are committed against this population. He also pointed out that 80 percent of the bodies of the murdered people were found in public spaces and private homes.
> 
> In 2020, four murders were reported in the Central American country. This implies a decrease of 51 percent compared to the same period of the previous year. Three of them were trans women and one gay person, while in 2019 they reported nine crimes.
> 
> In 2015, the Salvadoran Congress amended the penal code so that crimes committed due to discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation are convicted on the basis that they were committed out of hatred and can be punished with a penalty of 30 to 60 years in prison. To date, no case has achieved a hate crime conviction.
> 
> According to the Asociación Solidaria Para Impulsar el Desarrollo Humano (ASPIDH Arcoiris Trans), from 1993 to date some 600 trans women have been murdered, but very few cases have been investigated and prosecuted.
