Early this morning, 21-year-old Dayanne Scarlleth was brutally murdered on Tepic Nayarit.
Although paramedics came to her help, they could do nothing for her anymore because she showed no vital signs.
From Casa Trans Mty we join in the penalty that overruns your family and friends and demand that the authorities of Tepic conduct the relevant investigation following the gender perspective protocols that allow clarification of the transfeminicide of our sister so that it does not remain unpunished like many other cases of violence did our trans population.
RIP üôè
