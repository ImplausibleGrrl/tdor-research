These sources told this media that Bautista Bobadilla, between 35 and 40 years old, was at a gas station located on the Manzanillo-Minatitlán highway, when she was shot at by subjects traveling on a motorcycle.

So far there is no report of people detained by the ministerial authorities.

On July 7, the State Attorney General's Office (FGE) informed EstaciónPacífico.com that Valeria Carrasco, a trans woman from Colima, was found dead at her home in Villa de Álvarez. The institution in charge of the administration of justice in the entity assured that the investigation of this murder was being carried out with gender perspective protocols.

The transfeminicides of Fray and Valeria are added to a series of acts of gender violence that have occurred in recent months in Colima: the body of Perla Julissa, 15, was located on May 6 after being murdered and burned presumably by one of his high school classmates (also a minor).
