On February 13 , the lifeless body of Néstor Moreno Castillo, a 32-year-old trans woman who was stabbed to death , was found in Calarcá, Quindío. "She was a very happy woman, she always wanted to be called and recognized as" La Néstor, "said the Trans Community Network.

According to information from the network, in Colombia the situation of people is increasingly critical and has worsened lately. "They continue to kill us for detaching ourselves from the" norm "and for building ourselves as we have pleased, we continue to be the target of extremist and transphobic attacks," they said.

Another case was that of Giovanna Betancourt, a trans woman who dreamed of being a beautician. His body was found lifeless and with traces of violence in the early morning of Saturday, February 6, near the Metropolitan Cemetery of Cali.

In an interview with El Tiempo, representatives of the Santamaría Foundation explained that she had trained in a beauty academy, because “through that job possibility, she wanted to stop exercising sex work, since she considered it very dangerous, an analysis that supported starting from her experience and that of many of her friends ”.

In Sincelejo they murdered Angie Priscila Jeaniot Arévalo, a trans woman with great visibility in the region who was attacked with a knife to the thorax, which affected one of her lungs. The Trans Community Network confirmed that this event occurred in the El Porvenir neighborhood, in the morning of Saturday, February 6.

Caribe Affirmativo called on the Prosecutor's Office to "carry out an exhaustive evaluation of the facts, since there is the possibility of a femicide, motivated by the gender identity of the victim."

Trans women killed during the covid-19 pandemic

On March 3, Colombia Diversa revealed in the report 'This is how things are going: preliminary balance of violence against LGBT people in 2020 ', the figures of violence against this community.

According to the text, the pandemic failed to stop the violence against this population group. The data revealed say that in Colombia there were 75 homicides in 2020, which means 6 cases per month and one homicide every 5 days. But, these figures could be higher, since the Prosecutor's Office has not yet provided the complete information to the NGO.

Gustavo Pérez, coordinator of Human Rights of Colombia Diversa, told El Tiempo that the restriction measures imposed in 2020 by the covid-19 pandemic what they did was increase violence against the LGBT community.

“Instead of preventing violence against LGBT people, they exacerbated it, because many people had to be confined in unsafe spaces such as, many times, their families; for example, the case of a trans woman who was murdered in her home by her stepfather was presented, ”he commented.
