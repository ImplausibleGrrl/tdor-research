Guatemalan Andrea González, 28, was shot dead
Guatemalan LGBTIQ+ activist and leader Andrea González, 28, was shot dead in the country's capital, causing disgust and indignation in various national and international sectors.

González was killed on Friday night (11) in an armed attack north of the historic center of Guatemala City, denounced the organization Otrans Reinas de la Noche, of which she was the legal representative.

“The murder of our colleague Andrea deeply affects the whole of RedLacTrans, we have lost a young woman, fighter, undisputed leader, who was the director of the most important trans organization in Guatemala,” they said in a statement.

The US embassy in Guatemala highlighted in a statement González's work as a trans activist and leader of an initiative of the Regional Human Rights Project.

She added that she was a fellow of the State Department's International Visitor Leadership Program (IVLP) and is also a collaborator with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).

“The US embassy in Guatemala supports LGBTI+ people and calls for respect and tolerance for these people to live a life of dignity, inclusion and equality,” he said.

Meanwhile, Guatemalan ombudsman Jordán Rodas condemned the crime and recalled that “being part of #sexual diversity in Guatemala is a greater risk factor, in the face of violence and intolerance, of suffering aggression and losing one's life. We cannot tolerate this, these crimes must not go unpunished."

“We joined in the protests of repudiation for the vile murder of Andrea González, trans activist and former president of @InfoOTRANS,” wrote the international organization Oxfam Guatemala on Twitter.

Furthermore, it demanded that the authorities “clarify this fact” and reaffirmed its “commitment to defend the rights of trans people”.
