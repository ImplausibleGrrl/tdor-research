Three days after going missing, Ebeng Mayor, a non-binary trans person, was found dead, bloodied, and bruised, with a wooden stick impaled in their genitals. It was believed that they were raped before being killed. Another victim, transgender woman Jhie Bangkiao, was found naked with a bloodied head in a cemetery.

Both members of the transgender community were found brutally murdered, a few days after the celebration of International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia, Interphobia, and Transphobia

These brutal murders are not just a loss of life– these are also crimes fueled by hate. This goes to show that the passage of the SOGIE Equality Bill is urgent. What transpired is a clear manifestation that the LGBT+ community is not safe in the country. This is not the first case of aggression and harassment towards the LGBT+ community. It is high time for the state to recognize that these are not isolated cases, rather attacks that are based on the SOGIE of the victims. We have been a target of harassment in society for a long time, and this will go on as long as perpetrators are not held accountable, and as long as the culture of violence and transphobia exists in the Philippines.

Bahaghari-UP Baguio Chapter expresses our deepest condolences to the families of the victims. We are one with the clamor for justice. Furthermore, we call on the authorities to conduct a full investigation regarding the cases of Ebeng and Junjie, and to hold those involved accountable. We also call on the government to pass the SOGIE Equality Bill immediately. The passage of the bill is set to make the country a safer space for the LGBT+ community as it ensures that crimes against the LGBT+ are held accountable.

Nothing else is known at the moment about either murder. Please check back for updates.

Rest In Peace Non-binary trans person Ebeng Mayor, and trans woman Jhie Bangkiaowere.

> Today, we lost a member of the trans masculine community to a brutal criminal act.
> Ebeng Mayor, from Batasan Hills, Quezon City, was missing for three days before they were found dead and is believed to have been raped before their mutilation and murder. A wooden stick was found shoved into their genitalia. This brutal act is a clear indication of a hate crime.
> The trans masculine community is vulnerable to sexual violence in the Philippines, a country that condones rape culture and victim blaming and a president with a penchant for making rape jokes and derogatory remarks. In a survey we conducted in 2017, 28% of college level LGBT students reported experiencing sexual harassment.
> We call for a full and thorough investigation of this atrocious crime and for the perpetrators to be brought to justice to the full extent of the law. And we call for the immediate passing of the SOGIE Equality Bill, a law that has been languishing in the Senate, its passing delayed by cheap tactics by Senators like Villanueva, Sotto and Pacquiao.
> We express our deepest condolences to the family of the late Ebeng Mayor.

> A transgender rights organization based in the Philippines reported the brutal death of Ebeng Mayor, a trans man that had been missing for three days. The Transman Equality and Awareness Movement – Philippines reported Mayor’s body was discovered yesterday showing evidence of rape and genital mutilation. The group demanded a full investigation into what they called a hate crime.
> 
> “Today, we lost a member of the trans masculine community to a brutal criminal act,” the group posted to Facebook, adding their body showed signs of mutilation “before their rape and murder,” and that a “wooden stick was found shoved into their genitalia.”
> 
> Few other details were provided by the group regarding the life and murder of Mayor, who was from Batasan Hills, Quezon City. Transman Equality described the condition of their body as “a clear indication of a hate crime” in their call for a full investigation. No further details regarding suspects or the state of the police investigation were available. Transman Equality said Mayor’s murder affirmed the need to pass the much-delayed Sexual Orientation and Gender Expression Equality Bill (SOGIE), that codifies into law protections against discrimination based upon sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression.
> 
> The LGBTQ+ community in the Philippines is still reeling over the case of Jennifer Laude, a 26-year-old a transgender woman who was murdered in 2014 by U.S. Marine Joseph Pemberton. Pemberton had strangled Laude and drowned her in the toilet of a short-term motel in Olangapo after discovering during a sex act that Laude was transgender. The marine from New Bedford, Massachusetts, used a trans panic defense at trial, which was closed to the press and public. Even though he was found guilty of murder in 2015, Pemberton received a reduced sentence of 6 to 12 years in jail in part because of his defense strategy. Pemberton received a full pardon in September of last year, and was immediately deported to the U.S. where he faces a court martial.

> While no numbers were readily available to quantify the violence against the trans community in the Philippines, the trans folks continue to be killed in the U.S. at an alarming rate. 2020 saw 44 trans lives violently taken, a record for a single calendar year. Sadly, 2021 is proving even more deadly with 26 violent deaths so far this year in less than five months.
