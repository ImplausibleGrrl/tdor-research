Manaus (AM) - A transvestite was murdered at dawn this Saturday (13th), inside Motel Minha Pousada, on Avenida Samaúma, in the Monte das Oliveiras neighborhood, in the North Zone of Manaus. The victim, not yet identified, was found shot in the chest in a room at the establishment.

According to police information, the crime occurred around 2 am. The transvestite entered the motel accompanied by a man, who later left the establishment driving a white Prisma car.

When approaching the lobby alone, the client was stopped by the employee who had already heard the firearm shot. The man showed up to leave and then used the car to break into the motel gate.

The images of the security circuit were analyzed showing the man and the vehicle, which belongs to a military policeman. The Specialized Homicide and Kidnapping Precinct (DEHS) investigates the crime.

The transvestite's body was admitted at about 4:30 am, on the same day, at the Instituto Médico Legal (IML), where the organ is awaiting recognition by family members.
