> The family does not want the world to know that their son was dressed effeminately. He might have been cross-dressing, doing drag, or perhaps expressing his gender identity while washing their car. In any case, the person falls under our trans umbrella. I have talked to the Homicide officer in charge. I have filled an open records request and asked the civilian police oversite committee to investigate.

But since this is an ongoing investigation Isom said that she was not at liberty to speak to the victim’s gender expression.
