> It’s been a known fact that when it comes down to proper media coverage of trans murders we often see misgendering and deadnaming. Also in the Dallas/Fort worth area there was the recent murder of Kiér Lapri Kartier who following her murder she was misgendered and disrespected by local media in an article titled “Police investigate murder of man dressed as woman!”. Sadly Rubi Dominguez’s story was done a similar way, Telemundo Dallas did a story on Rubi in which they misgendered her and deadnamed her even though the family used the correct pronouns and name Telemundo still used the wrong ones. This has prompted this article to honor, respect and inform our readers of this murder with hopes of justice for Rubi and her family.

> Rubi’s family and friends are missing their daughter, sister and friend. TransGriot joins them in  calling for justice for Rubi! TransGriot and all of our contributors stand with the Dominguez family during these hard times and will continue to lift Rubi’s name and honor her life. This would make Rubi the 39th trans murder that we’re aware of and the 4th trans person murdered out of the Dallas area. Very special thank you to Stacey Monroe for the connection and information.
