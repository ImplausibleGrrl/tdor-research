> 
> The neighbors have known the family and Sofía forever: “We have known her for a long time, her gender changed over time, about ten years ago now. She was a good girl, sometimes impulsive. The neighbors on the block do not hear anything, no screams or things like that. The truth is a pity for the family. They all love each other very much, ”said a neighbor.
> 
> The effects of the PAT carried out a patrol in the area and after 18 o'clock it turned out that Brandon was "walking around Villa Gobernador Gálvez and some towns in the southern area." Around 19 members of the Homicide Squad of the Investigation Agency arrested Brandon C., who was transferred to the base of that division.
> 
> Sofía posted the slogan "I was born to be free, not murdered" on her social networks on September 7, but fate got her into a trap and at last she ended her days in the least expected way.
