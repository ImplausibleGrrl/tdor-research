> For the quote: Jessica was vibrant and full of life. She was loved by many in our community. Jessica volunteered frequently at the local LGBT center and would be at any and every event, protest, and march the center organized. She was fantastic at engaging with the community, and cared deeply for those around her. In the last few years of her life she lived as her authentic self, unafraid of who she was and expressed herself freely. Her happiness and energy was contagious. Her loss is felt deeply by all who knew her.



> Hello my name is Stacy. My transgender niece Jessica passed on July-18-21. she was a member of the LGBTQ+ community. She was so happy when she transitioned and was able to take female hormones. She suffered from schizophrenia and never finished the transition. She was found in a laundry mat and reported as an overdose but the coroner hasn't reported yet. She had been the victim of multiple hate attacks.
> 
> I want to thank all that have shared, contributed on here and in person. Those that have shared with us some very heartwarming stories of Jessica helping others. I always knew she had a huge heart and she'd help any way she could even though she had very little. Please continue sharing those stories and the fundraiser. Were almost at the amount to bring her home.
> 
> We are fundraising to cover the cost of her cremation and a celebration of life.
