JOINT NOTE OF Mourning, SOLIDARITY AND TAKEN OF PROVIDENCE.
The Municipal Council of Attention to Sexual Diversity and Gender Identity of Ribeirão black SP, National Alliance LGBTI+ and Ong Vitória Régia, comes through solidarity with family, friends and the LGBTQIA population +, for the death of Márcia Marcita and Milena Massaphere.
In Brazil, many ′′ T ′′ lives have been murdered in recent years, which leaves you front at the top of countries with more homicides of transgendered, transvestite and transsexual people. The data is scary but it represents no news for this almost invisible part of Brazilian society, which needs to resist a routine of exclusion and violence.
Recently on April 5th, 16-year-old teenager Pietra Valentina, stabbed in the city Juazeiro do Norte CE, also the passing of trans activist Vida Bruno, from Salvador BA, who passed away after staying two months admitted after being beaten in a city bar, and here in our region, Madalena Leite, the first transvestite councilwoman of Piracicaba SP, was found in the homeroom with signs of head aggression. We can't forget that a few months ago in our city. Alice Garrefa, who was brutally murdered in August 2.020 and the decomposing body was found on the Piracicaba River.
It's weird how the ′′ T ′′ community is exterminated and society doesn't revolt.
In our city on the morning of last Friday, April 9th, Márcia Marcita, was found dead by a friend, at her residence, located in the Avelino Alves Palma Industrial Park in the North area, and last Saturday, the 10th. , Milena Massafera was found with several stabbing punctures at her residence, located on Colonel Luiz da Cunha Street, in the Vila Tiberio neighborhood. Yet another case of extreme violence with a woman that emerges in less than 24 hours in our city.
We need to join hands in tackling the wave of hatred and growing intolerance in the country, as well as conservative and repressive attitudes seeking to silence the voices of the entire LGBTQIA population +, with the consequence of the death of many lives.
We can't shut up seeing that Brazil is the country that kills the most LGBTI in the world. It's people, mostly young women, who are being murdered for their sexual orientation or gender identity.
It is totally unacceptable for people to die because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. It's Totally Absurd!
We are in contact with the investigating authorities and will monitor their progress so that those responsible for the crimes are punished.
