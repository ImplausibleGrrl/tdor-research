The body of a transvestite, not yet identified, was located on ponte Imigrantes that connects Cuiabá and Várzea Grande, this Monday (24th). The corpse was in front of a billboard on the road. The victim's arms and hands were tied with a hose and with several bruises on his back.

According to information from the Homicide and Personnel Protection Police (DHPP), the Military Police received an anonymous tip informing them that there was a body at the scene. Upon arriving at the indicated location, the veracity of the facts was verified. 

Politec is on site and, according to preliminary information from an expert accompanying the case, the victim, who has no identification documents, is between 22 and 24 years old. The corpse has some details that suggest that it belongs to a transvestite, such as elongated nails and details on clothes.

According to the expert, the victim's back has deep bruises, probably caused by wooden boards - which must have been used in the beating session - and many injuries in the head region. In addition, the body was marked by the initials of the criminal faction Comando Vermelho (CV) in the lower back. There are no signs of gunshots in the body.

The Civil Police are on site and the case is ongoing.
