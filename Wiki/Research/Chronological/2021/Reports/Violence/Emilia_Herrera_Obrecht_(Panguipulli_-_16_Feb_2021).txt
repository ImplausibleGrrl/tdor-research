[Communicated] Mapuche woman murdered in Panguipulli, private guards would be involved
 February 17, 2021
Panguipulli, Lof Llazkawe, 17 February 2021.- Around midnight on February 16 we received the information that in Panguipulli route seven lakes in the sector the drainage of Lake Riñihue shot a Mapuche woman, moments later confirming his death.

It is Emilia Milen Herrera (25 years), who accompanied the process of territorial recovery initiated by the Lof Llazkawe against historical usurpation that they denounce by private condominiums, hotels and properties, valued between 6000 and 13000 UF. This is part of the collaboration and mutual support of communities and organizations that protect the San Pedro River.

The deceased lamgen came from the town of San Ignacio on the Valdivian coast; She taught mapunzungun, took care of animals and was vegan.

Emilia's mother Deniss Obrecht is currently denouncing that lawyers have been prevented from entering the autopsy, she was not notified of the start of this process as they argue that it is only the responsibility of the prosecutor on duty. He makes a strong call to the official media not to criminalize his daughter or the Lof LLazkawe. The latter due to biased headlines by local and national media, indicating the facts as clashes or confusing incidents.



Although it was known about the arrest of armed guards carrying shotguns, so far no charges and those responsible for the shooting have been reported, except for a short release issued where from the security company they indicate not being involved.

COMMUNICATED LOF LLAZKAWE


Communiqué February 17Lof Llazcawe, Riñiwe Drain, Panguipulli

As Lof Llazcawe wanted to report that on the day of yesterday almost midnight, she was killed by the sicarios guards of the Riñi Mapu condominium, our lamnien Emilia, Otres knew her as Bau. He fell for a bullet fired at his forehead by the hit guards themselves hired by the condo, who at the time were expelling some campers who were there, who asked for help in the face of threats from these hitmen.

It should be noted that the Riñimapu condominium had already called on the repressive police force to expel these campers during the afternoon and that they were themselves;guards and carabinieri, who authorized their stay at the site. That is why our little and lamnien come to demand to respect what they had agreed with the campers, but it is at that moment that they take the opportunity to shoot directly at our quarout and pu lamnien, falling our dear Emilia.

We publicly condemn these members commanded by Manuel García, who represents that condo, whom we blame for this led act. Again our land, our mapu welcomes a young weichafe, a beautiful being, kind, protective of the mapu until her last breath, a sister who placed her life in the defense of our Auke mapu. Chaw ngenechen welcomes you with our fallen weichafes in our wenu mapu, and from there you rise up as one more warrior spirit of our people.

Exigimos que los responsables de poner armas en manos de delincuentes, se hagan responsable del asesinato de nuestra querida Lamngen Emilia. Justicia para Emilia!

Si una cae, diez se levanta!
