Bold People / Magnolia Serrato Flowers.
Chalco, Méx.- Chalco Valley Sexual Diversity Collectives call for justice to the three government orders, for the trans-femicide of Chalque activist Naomi Alonso, a fighter for human rights and equality.
Naomi Alonso was reported missing on Wednesday, January 20th when she was traveling in a red truck in the vicinity of San Juan Tezompa and Ayotzingo communities in this municipality, from that time on she was no longer heard from her, so who filed the complaint conducting the search and finding it lifeless last Saturday 23 of this month.
In the face of the fact, the groups of diversity in this municipality, as well as others demand the clarification of the deprivation of liberty and crime to which the activist was targeted, because of gender dysphoria.
They indicated that her partner and friend, she was an excellent person, hardworking, entrepreneur and with a great human sense, with all the people who met her in life. '' We demand the clarification and sentence of this crime, which must be treated with a gender perspective, lack of respect for human rights and gender-based violence ", as a trans woman.
Rosaura Olivera Carrasco (Rossy Carrasco) of Chalco Diversity, accompanied by Esmeralda Navarro Hernandez (Meme Nava) of United for the Diversity of Valley of Chalco, among other activists, outside the facilities of the Chalco Justice Center indicated '' that it is necessary to visibilize violence in which the populations of sexual diversity are subjected, such as the case that lesbian women, gay women and trans women live, because they are considered a minority group, exposed to discrimination and marginalization, by guidance, diversity and identity of gender ".
He added that the vileness against these groups should be considered, approaching from the guidelines described in the Women's Law of a life free from violence, because so far there is a void for recognition of different identities, not known as heteronormades , so measurements and statistics need to include the different genres of diversity in order to create urgent projects to combat gender violence.
'' As well as the crimes committed against populations of sexual diversity, leaving them in disprotection of legal bases and the delivery of justice ", thus demanded the pronouncement and commitment of authorities at all levels of government to the investigation, to be found, as well as sentencing those guilty of the crime committed against Naomi Alonso.
His call for demand and justice is with the intention that this murder should not be a number more in the statistics '' no more transphobia, no more hate crimes, no more death, we ask for justice!".
