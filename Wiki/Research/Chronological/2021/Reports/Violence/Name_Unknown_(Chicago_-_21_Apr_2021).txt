CHICAGO —  Two people were killed, including a trans woman, after separate shootings that happened less than a mile from each other in West Pullman.

The first shooting happened just before 10 p.m. Wednesday on the 12200 block of South Harvard Avenue. Police said they responded to a ShotSpotter alert of gunfire and found a 20-year-old man, identified as Darius Fairley, shot multiple times. He was taken to the hospital where he was pronounced dead.

The second shooting happened about 30 minutes later on the 12000 block of South Indiana Avenue. Police said a woman was sitting alone in a Ford Fusion when someone came up and shot her multiple times. She was pronounced dead at the scene.

Sources close to the investigation said the woman identified as transgender, but her name has not been released at this time.

Kim Fountain, Chief Administrative Officer at the Center on Halsted, said this marks the third murder of a transgender women in Chicago in the last four months.

“It’s just absolutely tragic to see the level of violence that particularly Black trans women are exposed to,” Fountain said.

Police said they don’t know of anyone who witnessed either of the shootings. CPD is looking into if gender was a motive for her killing.

No suspects are in custody at this time. If you have any information, anonymous tips can be made at cpdtip.com.
