Stylist Diana Miranda turned 35 on Friday, her sister marked her all day to congratulate her, but she never responded and yesterday she went to find her in her apartment, in the colony San Miguel Chapultepec,found her in the bathroom with two knives attached.

Until before November, Diana lived in Ecatepec, but for three months she moved to department 201, on the corner of Avenida Jalisco and Gobernador José Guadalupe Covarrubias, in Miguel Hidalgo.

According to neighbors, Diana was booked,they used to see her walking her Yorkie puppy, she also used to park her white Hyundai I-10 car in front of the home, where friends visited her.

Her sister went to the apartment, but no one opened him even though the television was

on. Then he looked for a locksmith and upon entering he saw Diana lying in the bathroom and next to him was her cell phone. On March 11, 2019 Diana was harassed by two subjects—Oziel AH and Juan Carlos BG, 23 and 25—when she was walking in the company of a friend over Rio Consulate.

The friend claimed the compliments and in response the assailants broke the Hyundai I-10 medallion.
