> Four days before the start of 2022, the National LGBTIQ + Human Rights Observatory reported the murder of three members of the community and warned that the trend of the previous year continues, when more than 30 violent events with fatal consequences were recorded. For the Human Rights Ombudsman Jordán Rodas, these indices are worrying and are aggravated due to state neglect.

On the other hand, until December 14, 2021, the National Institute of Forensic Sciences (Inacif) served 83 people self-identified as belonging to the LGBTIQ + community nationwide. Among the cases, evaluations of external injuries with 37 victims stand out, followed by 14 medical examinations for sexual crimes.

In this case, the auxiliary of El Progreso of the PDH initiated a file and indicated that it will follow up on the actions of the Public Ministry (MP) for its resolution.
