> Greetings family. It is with heavy hearts that we make you aware of the passing of our Beloved Paris Rich. Paris was a young, beautiful trans person with lots of motivation to live life to the fullest! She loved and was very protective of her family and close friends. Paris was a very independent woman and had dreams of being a stylist to the stars one day. She was 25 years old. Paris was a close friend of Muhlaysia Booker who we lost due to gun violence in May of 2019. Paris left a lasting impression on everyone that she met and will sorely be missed.
