Valentina Gámez was beaten and strangled in her home in San Cristóbal, Táchira (Venezuela) on 10 Aug 2021.

She was 39.



> Not knowing the date of death, they located a lifeless transsexual in his house in the upper part of Pueblo Nuevo, on the way to Cueva del Oso, in the state of Táchira.
> 
> On Tuesday night, because the victim did not respond to his cell phone, some relatives approached the house in which he was living, owned by the mother, and found the lifeless body on calle Vista Hermosa, Paramillo sector.
> 
> They immediately notified the authorities, and a commission from the Bolivarian National Police (PNB) arrived at the site. Upon confirming that it was a homicide, they notified Cicpc officials of the situation, reported the newspaper La Nación.
> 
> José Gregorio Gámez, 39, who was known as Valentina, suffered blows to the face and other parts of the body. Although it was presumed, from the marks on the neck, that the cause of death was strangulation.
> 
> Gamez, who had breast surgery, was said to be lying on a bed, semi-clothed, at the time of the discovery. Dried blood indicated that it had been there for several hours.
> 
> They did not reveal the possible motive for the event, but they did not rule out the theft; nor that the perpetrator or perpetrators of the crime is known to the victim, since, apparently, the main door was not violated.
> 
> In any case, the Cicpc Homicide Axis carries out the pertinent investigations in order to clarify the crime and capture those responsible.
> 
> It is indicated that Gámez worked independently, without specifying the occupation. However, it was said that the transsexual had no known enemies, and that he had lived alone in that residence, since his mother left the country.
