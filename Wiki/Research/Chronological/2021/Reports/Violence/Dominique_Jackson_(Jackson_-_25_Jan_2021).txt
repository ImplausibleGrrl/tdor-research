Transgender woman Dominique Jackson murdered in Mississippi
Added by Kelli Busey on January 29, 2021.


Transgender woman, Dominique Jackson, 30, was shot and killed Monday night in Jackson Mississipi. The shooting happened just after 9:30 p.m. on Rose Street at Grand Avenue.

According to investigators, a vehicle struck a utility pole at the scene. A woman, who we identified as 30-year-old Dominique Jackson, was found inside suffering from a gunshot wound. She died at the scene.

WJTV and police misgendered and deadnamed Ms. Jackson, a well-known figure in the local community.

Thereâ€™s no suspect information at this time. If you have any information, contact Crime Stoppers at 601-355-TIPS(8477).

This video was shared on her timeline in May

Dominique was loved and will be missed by everyone that knew her. God rest her soul, Dominique Jackson is the 16th transgender person murdered in the US since November 20, 2020, our last Transgender Day of Remembrance (TDoR).

R.I.P. Dominique Jackson

#DearHumansof  JACKSON, MISS  JANUARY 24,2021 
***ADMIN NOTES---WHY...JUST WHY !!!!.??....What the hell is going on out there in Mississippi ???????..
Jackson police are investigating multiple weekend shootings, including two homicides.
I was the second homicide that happened that fatal day. 
My family said that I was supposed to start a new job Monday morning.
"For something like this to happen to her, it's just surprising. Just still can't wrap my mind around it," said my cousin, Cortez Singleton. "Someone got so upset that they decided to take the life of someone who has a 2-year-old daughter, who is just starting a new job today, and who just recently moved into her own place."
According to my cousin Cortez Singleton, the events that led to my death started about 3 a.m. Sunday in a parking lot near a north Jackson bar off County Line Road.
"Apparently, there were two gentlemen and one was upset about the parking spaces, or something to that nature," he said.
According to witnesses, someone followed the car I was riding in from the parking lot. Jackson police said the shooting happened on Interstate 220.
Another cousin of mines was driving the car and didn't realize I had been shot until they got home, Cortez Singleton said.
"She assumed that she was actually sleeping, and it wasn't until she got here (that) she tried to reach over and wake her up that she realized that I was shot once in my head and I was no longer here," he said.
The Singleton family is pleading with the shooter to surrender to police.
