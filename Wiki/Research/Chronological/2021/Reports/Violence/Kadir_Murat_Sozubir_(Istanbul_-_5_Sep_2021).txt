> HE SAID "LEGIBLE DEFENSE"
> In his statement, the suspect Abdürrahim E. claimed that he went to Kadir Murat Sözübir's loft house in Fatih, where he lived alone, for the purpose of sexual intercourse. Suspect Abdurrahim E, who claimed that Sözübir realized that he was trans after he undressed. "We had agreed on 100 TL on the phone before. I left the money on the table. I wanted to get the money back because I did not want to be in a relationship with a trans person. He did not give the money back. He pushed me, insulted me. We started running. I thought about running away, but at that time he injured me with an object. So I took out the switchblade knife I was carrying and shook it randomly 3-4 times. I acted with purely self-defense intent. He got down and informed his family. He was conscious at that time. I left the house and went to Balat. "I went straight. I regret it, so I surrendered. I demand my release."

> "I HAD A VERY GOOD NEIGHBOR"
> He lived here alone. His mother passed away and we saw his father at the funeral," he said.
