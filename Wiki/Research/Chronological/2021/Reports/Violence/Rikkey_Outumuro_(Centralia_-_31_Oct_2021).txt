> Trans Latina Rikkey Outumuro aka Tru Starlet Murdered by Boyfriend in Washington State
> November 3, 2021 by Sue
> 
> Her name was Rikkey Outumuro, also known by her stage name Tru Starlet. Rikkey was a 39-year-old Latina transgender woman and performer. She was fatally shot in Centralia, Washington, on the night of Oct. 30 or the morning of Oct. 31, 2021.
> 
> Rikkey was killed by her 28-year-old boyfriend who shot her at least five times and left her body on their sofa, next to their six-year-old son. The killer is in jail without bail, charged with first degree murder and other charges. He has a history of gun violations. Their son is with Rikkey’s family.
> 
> Rikkey died due to domestic violence, a scourge that often is overlooked in the LGBTQ community. According to HRC:
> 
> Tragically, interpersonal violence accounts for a significant number of fatalities against transgender and gender non-conforming people. In 2020, approximately seven in ten transgender and gender non-conforming people killed as a result of fatal violence were killed by an acquaintance, friend, family member or intimate partner. Unfortunately, the relationship of the victim to the killer is still unknown for close to one-third (30%) of all known cases. This means that anywhere from 44% to 74% of victims since 2013 were violently killed by someone they knew, including intimate partners, family members, friends, peers and acquaintances.
> 
> Additionally, according to the 2015 United States Transgender Survey, 54% of transgender and non-binary people have experienced some form of intimate partner violence in their life. 
> 
> Rikkey’s friends and loved ones are sharing their fond memories across social media. She is remembered as an active and ardent member of the queer community, a frequent performer at local Pride events, and  a vibrant friend.
> 
> She was always profoundly herself and a brilliant light for countless loved ones and folx in Centralia and Olympia, WA.
> 
> Rikkey is the forty-fourth trans, nonbinary or gender nonconforming person reported killed in 2021. Thirty-nine of these neighbors have been BIPOC. 29 of these victims were under the age of 30. That we know of, as many deaths go unreported or unacknowledged. Since January 1, 2021, there has been a murder every 6.9 days on average. I also noticed that Rikkey at age 39 is the fifh oldest victim of this terror campaign in 2021. Three of the four most recent reported deaths have been in the Pacific Northwest.
> 
> Here in Pittsburgh as I write this, I think of Chyna Carrillo, another trans Latina who was murdered by a boyfriend – a man with a previous conviction of murder who served less than ten years for killing his 20-year-old wife. Had he been sentenced properly, he would not have been able to kill Chyna. Had we the guts to enact meaningful gun control legislation, to create strong domestic violence prevention programs, to recognize that violence against all women is violence against all women. Had we the will to do these things …
> 
> The total number of transgender, nonbinary, and gender nonconforming persons murdered in 2021 now equals 2020, a record breaking year going back as long as the data has been tracked. And there are still two months to go. And I’m already investigating another reported homicide.
> 
> 44 lives gone and 44 families lives shattered. Ranging in age from 16 to 49.
> 
> 44 is a number so many fox have dreaded these past months and now that it is here, we have to face the reality that in this culture of transphobia toxicity, it will continue to rise. When I share these posts on social media, I often see comments like “When will this stop?” and the answer is when we stop tolerating this form of terror. When organizations with multimillion budgets and national LGBTQIA+ foundation invest in trans led efforts. It is not going to stop til we wise up.
> 
> Friends have arranged a crowdfund and a Facebook fundraiser to support Rikkey’s son and other family members. Hope Alliance of Lewis County has arranged a vigil on Friday, November 5 from 6-7 PM at Pine Street Plaza.
> 
> This event is to honor the life and legacy of a devoted queer activist, advocate, and pioneer who endlessly worked to improve the lives of the trans and queer community within Lewis County.
> 
> Rest in power, Rikkey. You brought so much to your community and family. It is horrifying that you lost your life at the hands of someone who was supposed to love you. Your friends and true loved ones have rallied to seek justice in your name, protect others from a violent predator, and ensure your son is safe. I am so sorry we did not create a safer world for you, a world where you could be safe in your own home. Thank you for all that you did to create a better world. May we carry that light forward.
> 
> May your memory be a revolution.





> A candlelight vigil honoring the victim of a Centralia murder will be held from 6 to 7 p.m. Friday at the Pine Street Plaza in Centralia.
> 
> Rikkey Outumuro was found dead in the 800 block of South Gold Street the morning of Oct. 31 with five gunshot wounds to the chest.
> 
> Her suspected killer, Cristopher Allen Gaudreau, 28, of Centralia, was arrested that same day and has been charged with first-degree murder, domestic violence. He is currently being held at the Lewis County Jail without bail. He has an arraignment hearing in Lewis County Superior Court scheduled for Nov. 4.
