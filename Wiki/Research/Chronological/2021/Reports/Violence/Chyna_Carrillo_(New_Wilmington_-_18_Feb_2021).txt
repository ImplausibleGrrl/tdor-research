beaten




Twenty-five-year-old Transgender woman Chyna Carrillo was beaten to death Thursday in western Pa. 
Officers Black and Long,Public information officers for the Butler State police barracks identified victim as a transgender woman in first reports. 

Following that they tweeted a statement deadnaming her despite knowing that she is transgender.

Multiple messages left for Officer Black have not been returned.

We spoke with Dana Rasmussen Treasurer and board member for TransFamily of NWPA, in a neighboring county where the murder occured.

She was horrified that her murder happened so close and equally upset that the state police knew she was transgender yet choose to deadname her.

Knowing that he victim was originally from the Springfield area Dana contacted Lisa Stewart President of the Local Transgender Equality Network. Stewart confirmed with Rasmussen that her name was Chyna Carrillo and that she was a transgender woman. 


Her aunt Mayra Carrillo asked if we could include her 21st birthday picture.
Her loving aunt asked that we tell everyone that "She was so full of love and light."

Chyna Carrillo identifies on Facebook bio as a "Proud Preop TransLatina! Outspoken, Unapologetic, Lethal Mind and Killer Looks
And gorgeous Chyna Carrillo Instagram pictures clearly show a proud TransLatina woman.

We owe a debt of gratitude to Dana Rasmussen for her dedication and proficient detective work. Thank you Dana! We can now #SayHerName
