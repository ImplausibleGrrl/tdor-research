shot


The body of a transvestite, who would be known as “India”, was found without her left ear and with gunshot wounds to her neck and chest, on Thursday night (25), at Rua das Cacimbas, located in Bairro Amapá, Núcleo Cidade Nova, in Marabá.

The images that circulate on the internet show the transvestite immersed in a pool of blood on the ground, with her eyes open, in the middle of the bush. The circumstances of the crime are still unknown, but the possibility of revenge is worked out. She would be a drug user.

A Military Police garrison was mobilized to preserve the crime scene. Hours later, a team from the Scientific Expert Center “Renato Chaves” removed the body from the morgue.

In contact with a reporter for the Portal Debate Carajás , delegate Vinícius Cardoso das Neves, director of the 21st Urban Civil Police Section, informed that the case is already being investigated by the Homicide Division, who also attended Rua das Cacimbas last night.

Violence
Over the past year, 175 transsexual and transvestite people have been murdered in Brazil, which is equivalent to one death every two days. The data were collected in the annual report of the National Association of Transvestites and Transsexuals (Antra).

The same report points out that, in Pará, four people from the social minority were murdered in 2020. It was the state that killed the most trans and transvestites in the Northern Region in the period.

Amazonas and Rondônia appear with three deaths. Tocantins, Acre and Roraima registered one each. Amapá was the only Brazilian state not to kill the plot last year, according to the report.

São Paulo is the leader on the list, with 29 deaths. Ceará (22), Bahia (19), Minas Gerais (17) and Rio de Janeiro (10) come next. (Vinícius Soares / Debate Carajás)
