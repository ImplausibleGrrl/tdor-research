> 
> For Caribe Affirmative, these events are alarming, considering that "in Riohacha, in recent days, cases of violence and acts of intolerance have been reported in public spaces in which the exercise of violence against dissident bodies has been legitimized. (Of diverse gender identity or expression) ".
> 
> The organization called on the Prosecutor's Office to carry out an investigation: "in view of the situation of vulnerability and visibility due to gender expression, it is required to take into account the thesis of violence due to prejudice, since stigmas and stereotypes could have been the cause. "
> 
> This case joins that of  Christina Cantillo MartÃ­nez , a trans woman and social leader who was murdered in Santa Marta, also this Tuesday, while she was chatting with her relatives at the door of her residence. Those responsible would be two men who were mobilizing on a motorcycle. The grill man drew a firearm and shot him repeatedly.
> 
> "This December 7, 2021 would be a regrettable date for people with diverse sexual orientations and gender identities in the Colombian Caribbean," they stated from the Caribbean Affirmative.
> 
> With these two cases, the Human Rights Observatory of that organization has registered 20 murders of LGBTI people in the Caribbean region during 2021.
