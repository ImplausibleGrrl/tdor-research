PGPD Investigating Fatal Shooting in Suitland
The Prince George's County Police Department's Homicide Unit is actively working to make an arrest in a fatal shooting in Suitland late Saturday night. The victim is 20-year-old Tavahn Ashton of Suitland. She was a transgender female whose first name was Taya.

On July 17, 2021, at approximately 9:55 pm, officers responded to an apartment in the 2300 block of Brooks Drive for a shooting. The victim was located inside of her apartment suffering from a gunshot wound and was pronounced dead on the scene.

Detectives are working to identify a suspect (s) and determine a motive. Based on the preliminary investigation, at this time, detectives do not believe this was a random crime. At this point in the investigation, we have uncovered no evidence suggesting Taya's murder was due to her gender identity, but as in all cases, we explore all possibilities.
