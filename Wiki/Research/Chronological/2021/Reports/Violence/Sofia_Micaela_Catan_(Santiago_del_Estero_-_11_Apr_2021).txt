After dying a week, Micaela Catán died of cardiac arrest
"Mica" had compromised airways due to burns suffered in a confusing episode that is being investigated.
Sofía Micaela Catán loved her nephews, whom she “spoiled”. He was a happy person and always tried to be well and enjoy his family. He died and with it he took the "secret" of what happened the fateful morning in which he suffered extremely serious burns that put his life in "check".
"Mica" had been in a relationship with Patricio Orellana for eleven years. He lived on José Santillán Street, in the Santa Rosa de Lima neighborhood in the Capital. She liked to play soccer and used to hang out with her friends and family for talks and laughter.
Around two in the morning on Sunday the 4th of this month, Marina Catán - Micaela's sister - was resting at home and was awakened by an outrageous knock at her door. It was Orellana, who told him: "Your sister was burned." Desperate, Marina and her brothers went out to see what had happened. They found Micaela almost unconscious, with severe burns on her face, chest and arms.
That would be the last image that his relatives will remember of "Mica." The victim was transferred to the Dr. Ramón Carrillo Regional Hospital in serious condition. The doctors indicated that he had first and second degree burns in 40 percent of the body. His condition was critical, because his airways were compromised.
Amid the uncertainty of knowing what happened to "Mica", her family and friends visited her in the hospital. They hoped that he would show some improvement. But as the days went by, the young woman's health condition was getting worse every day.
On Saturday afternoon, the doctors informed Micaela's relatives that "her health was critical and that it had become complicated in the last hours." In this way, hopes were running out, while those close to him asked for "justice to be done and to know what had happened."
The tragic news that hit the Catan family hard came around 12 yesterday. "Micaela suffered two cardiorespiratory arrests and, unfortunately, died", were the words that the doctors spoke to the victim's sisters. Immediately,
The body of the young trans woman was transferred to the judicial morgue of the Independencia hospital at the request of the capital prosecutor, Dr. Celia Inés Mussi, where the corresponding autopsy will be performed, in order to reliably establish the details of her death, while Investigations of the fact continue.

"We will never forget my sister" 

With broken voices and tears in their eyes, Micaela Catán's sisters asked that "the young woman's partner be arrested and that justice be done for her death."
In dialogue with Nuevo Diario, Soledad revealed: “We will never forget my sister. We want to know what happened to her and that justice be done for her death. We ask that he -for Patricio Orellana- be arrested and that all this be clarified. "
" My sister was a very happy person who lived laughing and playing with my children and my other nephews. She always spoiled them and took care of them. There have been many beautiful memories of her in us, ”said the young woman.
Micaela's remains will be buried today in the La Piedad cemetery.

"With great sadness, we regret the death of our partner" 

While Justice advances in the investigations on the confusing episode, where Micaela Catán suffered burns and that later cost him his life, from the NGO Divas Santiago del Estero they referred to the irreparable loss.
Through an official statement that was published on social networks, the members of the NGO where Micaela was active, expressed: “'Mica', as we said, had dreams, hope and desire to improve her quality of life. Through the Empower Work program, he had resumed his primary studies, he loved to play soccer, he had built his little house with great sacrifice.
'Mica' was present in each workshop, in each activity carried out by the organizations, always smiling and joking with the colleagues. It was the questioner of the WhatsApp groups. But, a week ago he was a victim of the Patriarchal Transodium. A week ago he was fighting for his life.
Today, at 27, Micaela could not resist the burns on her body. It could not even reach the average lifespan of 35 to 40 years that the trans population has.
Today we are in mourning. This painful fact reminds us of the Wanda Taddei case. That is why we demand justice with a gender perspective.
From Divas and Attta Santiago del Estero we accompany their relatives, friends and colleagues with great pain. Justice for Micaela ”. (sic).

SANTIAGO DEL ESTERO - Sofía Micaela Catán, the young trans woman who had been hospitalized for a week with burns on 50% of her body, died yesterday morning after an argument with her partner. The 24-year-old had been admitted last Saturday night. Her partner abandoned her while some neighbors helped her. He took his documents and the money he had collected.
Although the relatives and friends of the victim speak of a transfemicide, the investigation of the facts is in charge of the prosecutor Celia Mussi.

That night, Micaela arrived at the Regional Hospital guard in the company of a neighbor, who helped her by hearing her desperate screams. He had entered with serious burns on his body, which he would have suffered when he was with his partner, in the house they shared on Quinto Pasaje, in the Santa Rosa de Lima neighborhood.
Soledad Catán, the victim's sister, stated that Micaela has very serious injuries “on her face, hair, all over her torso and legs. "In the latter part of 12 (around noon on Sunday) they told us that they had intubated her and that her lungs are compromised by the smoke she inhaled."

According to Soledad, her sister lived with her partner - for them, the author of the injuries - for ten years. Currently they were doing it in a place that the latter had lent them, since the young woman could not continue paying the rent of the place where they were.
