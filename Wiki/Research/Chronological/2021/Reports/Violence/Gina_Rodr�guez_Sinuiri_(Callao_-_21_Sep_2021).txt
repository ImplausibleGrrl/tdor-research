> 
> The attack compromised her vital organs such as the pancreas, liver, vessels and others, and she was transferred to the San José hospital, where she fought for her life, but unfortunately she died yesterday morning.
> 
> The victim's friends denounced that a Venezuelan citizen whom she received on several occasions in her room could be the murderer, since he fled the place when Gina was bleeding, so the authorities have him as the main suspect in the homicide.
> 
> Gina was born in Pucallpa, from where she traveled to find a better opportunity in the city of Lima, working as a prostitute. However, she met a tragic death after her executioner stabbed her lifeless, when she was inside the Airport Hotel, where she had lived several months ago.
> 
> According to witnesses, Rodríguez Sinuiri had the alleged murderer as a friend, who was identified as Ángel Gutiérrez, whose whereabouts are not yet known.
>

> Gina Rodríguez Sinuiri , a young 28-year-old transgender woman, died this last Tuesday, September 21 after being attacked by a subject inside a room that she rented inside a hotel in Callao . Although she was taken to the San José Hospital, her body could not resist the injuries.
> 
> According to the first investigations, the suspect would be a subject known as Ángel Rodríguez or Ángel Gutiérrez, since, according to the victim's best friend, he changes his identification on social networks and his appearance on several occasions.
> 
> So far the whereabouts of the transfeminicide are not known , so Gina's neighbors and friends ask the hostel where the crime happened to share the videos of the security cameras, in order to have more precise information on the traces of the culprit.
> 
> The body of Gina Rodríguez remained in the central morgue of Callao and was later veiled at the house of a friend, to later be taken to Pucallpa, her city of origin, where she will finally be buried.
> 
> Faced with this crime, the Ministry of Women and Vulnerable Populations ruled on the matter and asked both the Public Ministry and the Judiciary for a thorough investigation and the corresponding sanction to the person responsible for Gina's death.
> 
> "From the MIMP we condemn the brutal murder of Gina Rodríguez Sinuiri , who died on Monday after receiving two stab wounds. This fact constitutes a transphobic hate crime . We demand that the Peruvian Prosecutor's Office and the Judicial Power investigate thoroughly and punish those responsible", they mentioned.
> 
> They also assure that "we will continue working to eradicate violence and discrimination faced by the LGTBI population , within the framework of Law No. 30364 and the National Gender Equality Policy."
> 
> For her part, the activist and former candidate for Congress, Gahela Cari , argued that "this transfemicide not only takes away a trans woman from us, but also destroys her family and affects us as a society. Concrete measures are urgently needed to eradicate transphobia."
> 
> Meanwhile, various organizations in favor of the rights of the LGTBQ + community denounced "the abandonment and violence in which the trans population is found in our Callao region; since, there are no public policies, much less ordinances that defend or protect our lives in the face of acts of violence and discrimination".
