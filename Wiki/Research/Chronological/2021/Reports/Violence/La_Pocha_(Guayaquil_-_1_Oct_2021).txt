A 34-year-old transgender woman received two stab wounds next to the bridge that connects avendas José María Velasco and 17, near a section of the Salado estuary boardwalk, in western Guayaquil.

On the morning of this Friday 1, the victim was identified by the residents as alias La Pocha, who allegedly had a sentimental relationship with the man who attacked her with a knife after an argument.

The body, which has two wounds on the neck, was picked up by Legal Medicine and transferred to the Criminalistics and Forensic Sciences Laboratory, on Rodríguez Bonín Avenue.


Neighbors commented that La Pocha apparently had consumption problems and lived on the street with her partner, who is main suspect. The Police are looking for the subject.

According to figures from the Center for the Promotion and Action of Women (Cepam-Guayaquil), at least seven crimes of this type, considered transfemicides, have been registered this year at the national level.

A 30-year-old man was stabbed to death on the streets of Medardo Ángel Silva and 7ª, in the suburb, last Thursday night. The attack would have occurred in the middle of an argument with another person, police agents said.
