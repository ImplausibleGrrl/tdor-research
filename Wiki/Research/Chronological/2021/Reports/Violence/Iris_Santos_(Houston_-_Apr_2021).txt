> Iris is the twenty first trans, nonbinary or gender nonconforming person reported killed in 2021. Nineteen of these neighbors have been BIPOC. She is the fifth victim who identified as Latinx.  In total, there have been twenty-one murders or suspicious deaths in the first 112 days of 2021, an average of one death every 5.3 days. 15 of these victims were under the age of 30. So far. That we know of as many deaths go unreported or unacknowledged.  Note – in this summary, I include suspicious deaths that as you can read below are often later confirmed homicides.
> 
> The horror of so many young lives lost fills me with despair – 75% are under the age of 30. At this time in 2020, we had documented the loss of nine trans neighbors – a year that eventually broke records by recording 44 deaths. We are at 20 deaths this year and that leaves me quite fearful of what might come next. I urge all of you to double down on your investment in your local trans community. The solution will come from well-resourced trans leaders, not from outside. It also requires you and me to actively resist the demonization of trans KIDS who want to play sports.
> 
> Rest in power, Iris. We do not yet know many details about your life, but we are unanimous is saying you should have been able to eat a meal outside a fast food restaurant without being shot. You deserved many more years to infuse the world with your own magic.
> 
> May your memory be a revolution.
