> Nicaragua: Hate crime against a transgender young woman
> 
> In the last few hours, a new hate crime has been known about a 18-year-old Nicaraguan girl. On Tuesday, two alcoholic men killed Lala, a trans woman who had just begun with her transition. FemiTransLac report that in Nicaragua they do not respect the rights of the community and the facts are becoming more violent.
> 
> Lala died from head trauma due to the blows against her head. Her body, found on Wednesday, the attackers are already in custody.
> 
> According to the sexual diversity organizations in Nicaragua, an uptick of assaults on the LGTBI population has been manifested in the last minute. As far as the year goes, they already have 9 cis women killed, which is why they call on the state to create the conditions to stop these hate crimes.
> 
> What hurts us the most is that it's a young girl who was just starting her transition. She was 18 years old and we ask for Justice, that the full weight of the law be dropped. May the State of Nicaragua pledge to respect the rights of the LGTBI community and pass a gender identity bill. Since the lack of laws we suffer multiple violence.
