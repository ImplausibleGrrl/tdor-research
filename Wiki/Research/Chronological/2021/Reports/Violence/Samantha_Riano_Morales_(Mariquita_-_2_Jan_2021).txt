The Trans Community Network, an organization that works for the rights of the trans population in Colombia, denounced this Monday, through its social networks, the murder of a trans woman in the municipality of Mariquita, in Tolima.

The victim was identified as Samantha , whom her associates affectionately called Sammy. Local media report that the woman worked as a stylist in that municipality.

According to the information shared by that organization, the events occurred on Saturday, January 2, when  Samantha "was attacked by armed men who were mobilizing on a motorcycle and fled the scene without being identified . "

The attackers, added that organization, "came to calle 10, between carrera 2 and 3, and indiscriminately fired at Sammy's humanity."

At the moment, the authorities have not issued a piece of information about the fact. However, family and friends raised a call through social networks for the motives of the crime to be investigated and the whereabouts of those responsible be found.

The Trans Community Network also reported that this is the first murder of a person with trans life experience that is recorded in 2021 .

According to a count carried out by that same organization, in 2020 31 cases of trans people murdered in the country were documented.

"The situation does not seem to improve," they lamented, while saying: "Trans people want to live ... not just survive."
