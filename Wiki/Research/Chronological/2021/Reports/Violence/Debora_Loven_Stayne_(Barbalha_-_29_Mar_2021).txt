The former president of the Ceará Transvestite Union (UTC), Débora Loven Stayne, 44, died on Monday afternoon, 29, in Barbalha, a municipality located in Cariri. Débora was a candidate for councilor in Juazeiro do Norte by the Social Democratic Party (PSD) in 2020.

In a statement, the Civil Police said she is suspected of attempting to assault a woman on a city street. A man, who was driving a car at the scene, saw the situation and ran over Deborah as a way to prevent the assault, causing death. The medical service was called, but she ended up dying on the spot.

A compressed air gun, knife and sickle were seized with Débora, who had a criminal record for personal injury. An investigation was launched to investigate the circumstances surrounding the incident. The man responsible for the hit-and-run has already appeared at the Barbalha Municipal Police Station and investigations are ongoing.

The PEOPLE tried to contact the Ceará Transvestite Union to find out more information about the case, but did not receive a return call until the publication of this article.
