> The murder of Valery Pereira adds to the count of transfemicides and violence against trans women in Honduras.

> 
> Since June 2009 there have been  380 violent LGBTI deaths , of which 120 are trans people. The cases have a 91% impunity rate. Despite having achieved the inclusion in the new Penal Code of the aggravating circumstance of violence based on sexual orientation, expression and gender identity, no sentence in this country has taken it into account.

> Pain in the Lima trans community
> 
> Valery Pereira  was a trans woman known in La Lima for her work as a beauty stylist, for her cheerful and fun character and her gift for making friends with people. Until the time of her death, Pereira worked at the Cristina's Nail Center Salon & Spa beauty center.

> “Unfortunately we have lost a loved one, loved by many friends and clients, a friend, our co-worker and for me as my daughter!”, The owner of Cristina's, a beauty salon in La Lima, wrote on Facebook. “It hurts my soul to know that we will no longer have that joy that characterized her in our living room. Rest in peace, Vielka! All your coworkers will take you deep into our hearts. We love you! See you soon ".
> For her co-worker Vivian Torres, the new mortal victim of transphobic violence was "the happiness of the beauty salon" where she worked. "It's too much pain," Torres added to Report Without Fear. Pereira "was very important" to his colleagues and clients.
