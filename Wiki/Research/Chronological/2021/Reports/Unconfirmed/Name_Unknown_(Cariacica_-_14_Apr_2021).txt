A transvestite was stabbed at dawn on Wednesday (14) in the Vila Capixaba neighborhood, in Cariacica, in Greater Vitória. According to information from the Civil Police, the victim was taken to the hospital in serious condition, with deep cuts and bruises on his body.

The crime took place around midnight. After being beaten, the woman asked the motel security guard for help. According to him, the victim usually does programs and is known in the region.

However, as she did not have documents, she has not been identified so far. She is about 40 years old, according to the police report.

The Civil Police still do not know what motivated the assaults and under what circumstances they occurred. The crime was registered as an attempted murder by a firearm on duty at the Homicide and Personal Protection Police (DHPP) and will be investigated.
