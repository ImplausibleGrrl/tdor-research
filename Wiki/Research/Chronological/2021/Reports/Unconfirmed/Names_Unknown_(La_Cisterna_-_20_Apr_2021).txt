A brutal case of assault and beating of two transgender women denounced the Amanda Jofré Union of Trans Sex Workers and Transvestites.

The incident occurred last Tuesday, April 20, at around 9:00 pm in the commune of La Cisterna when two sex workers were attacked by a group of four men.

According to the version of the “Amanda Jofré” union, the four individuals attacked both women by surprise at the point of chains, stones, sticks, fists and feet.

“The beating was fierce and full of hate speech. The companions did not have time to react, since they attacked them separately ”, they assured from the organization.  

One of the victims alerted the neighbors with her screams, who upon seeing the situation managed to intimidate the subjects, who fled the place.

Regarding the state of health, both victims have different injuries to the head and different parts of the body. One of them was urgently admitted to the San José Hospital.

The organization demanded justice for the attack, since “we no longer want to bury our friends before the age of 35. We no longer want to have to expose our daily lives in the streets because we do not have access to the world of formal work . We do not resist any more blows or hatred ”.
