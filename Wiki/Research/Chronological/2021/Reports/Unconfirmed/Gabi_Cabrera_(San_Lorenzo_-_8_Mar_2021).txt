beaten (survived?)


A trans woman was found this morning in San Lorenzo totally handcuffed and with obvious signs of assault on her body. She reported having been forcibly taken by unknown persons aboard a vehicle and subsequently dumped near the bed of the stream.


Around 11:00 this Monday, a 22-year-old trans woman was found on the banks of the San Lorenzo stream, in the city of the same name.

The information was confirmed by activist Yren Rotela, who told TODAY that this person was tied hand and foot and gagged at the time of his rescue.

After being transferred to a healthcare center for a medical inspection, it was found that this person had traces of trauma in various parts of the body such as the rib and stomach.

According to the victim's account, she was attacked between 5 and 6 in the morning by a group of unknown men, who beat her when she was on her back and left her unconscious, later placing a bag on her head before taking her into a private vehicle.

After several hours disappeared, her attackers left her on the banks of the stream, a place from where she would have crawled until she reached a nearby house, being helped by the owner of the house who was in charge of calling the police, Rotela mentioned.

The trans woman attacked is a sex worker who was making her usual journey to the center of San Lorenzo, as detailed.

In addition to having been beaten, it is not ruled out that the victim has also been the subject of a rape, a diagnosis that still could not be precisely confirmed.

Rotela confirmed that they will follow up on this case to try to identify those responsible, filing the formal complaint with the National Police and the Public Ministry.
