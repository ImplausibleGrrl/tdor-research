shot (survived?)


A confusing episode occurred in the Colombia Granaderos neighborhood, as a 34-year-old trans person known as Thalia was shot in the back. He is in serious condition at the Hospital Escuela.

Thalia, who regularly frequents some areas of Independencia Avenue, and is known for various acts of violence, was apparently under the influence of drugs and causing disturbances at a party that was held on Santa Rosa and Necochea avenues.

In an altercation, he was allegedly shot in the lower back with a firearm, causing an entry hole in his body.

She was quickly transferred to the Hospital Escuela, where she underwent surgery.
