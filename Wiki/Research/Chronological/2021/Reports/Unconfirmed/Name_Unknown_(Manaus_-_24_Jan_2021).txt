Manaus/AM - A body, not yet identified, was found inside a manhole of an estancia this Sunday morning (24th), on rua Malvarisco, in bueiro [neighborhood] Jorge Teixeira, in the East Zone. The victim's hands were severed. 

The body was found by the owner of the space, while he was cleaning the place. He smelled a strong odor from the manhole and decided to open the lid if there was any clogging.

In doing so, he came across the body that is already in a state of decomposition and may be that of a transvestite.
 
The police were called and the Fire Department was also called to act in the rescue. What is known so far is that the victim has deep marks of a bladed weapon, supposedly third-party and is without both hands.

The suspicion is that the crime occurred near the resort and the body was spilled in the manhole. With the force of the water, he ended up being dragged from it and was engaged in the stretch of the resort. The victim's rescue is still being done. More information in a moment.

A team from the Amazonas Military Fire Brigade (CBMAM) went to the scene to remove the body from the manhole. 

The body was taken to the Legal Medical Institute (IML), where it will undergo an autopsy exam and be identified. 

The victim was beheaded and had one hand severed, according to Chief Fábio Silva, from the Specialized Homicide and Kidnapping Precinct (DEHS). "Due to our investigative work, we suspect that the victim fell into a manhole higher up, and after the rain, the corpse was moved here," he said.

The Department of Technical-Scientific Police (DPTC) informed the delegate that the body had been in place for less than ten days. “We will try to do some survey with the fingerprints to identify who this person is. Maybe we can only do it through DNA testing, ”said Silva. 

The official also said that the type of injuries found on the body raises the suspicion that the motivation of the case is related to drug trafficking.
