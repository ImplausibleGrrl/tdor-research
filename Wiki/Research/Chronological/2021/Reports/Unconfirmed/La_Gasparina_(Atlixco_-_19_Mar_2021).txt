The LGBTT community has once again demonstrated in protest at the recent hate crime of another of its members, the second in the current administration of the president of Atlixco, Guillermo Velázquez Gutiérrez . It cannot be left without mentioning that in this same municipality the activist was assassinated nine years ago and by whom she set the precedent so that this year the “Agnes Law” will be created .

On Friday, the murder of three people in the Atlixco region was announced here, including a woman and a man who wore some women's clothes, so it was thought that they had left him that way on purpose, but today it is known that he was a transvestite.

It was about who was called Victor Edgar who was nicknamed by his acquaintances as "La Gasparina" and was esteemed by several people who knew that he was dedicated to selling seasonal products to survive, but he even offered garlic.

The complainants say that last month he received death threats, which is why they already gave that data to the ministerial authorities for the rigorous investigations.

His body was found in the vicinity of the Cerro de San Miguel , with various stab wounds.
