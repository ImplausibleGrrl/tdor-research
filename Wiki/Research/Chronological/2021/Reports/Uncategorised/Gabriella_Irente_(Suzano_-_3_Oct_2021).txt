Interview:

//Gabriella Irente, 23, is a singer and was born in Suzano. His family is of Italian and Spanish descendants. Her transition started after finishing her studies because, according to her, it would be more difficult to start while I was studying because of the problems she would face at school. “It was a phase of self-knowledge and acceptance. In the beginning, it was very complicated by the lack of knowledge and not knowing what was happening to me”, says the singer. But something helped her a lot: the appearance of drags and trans in the media. “It was much easier to understand me,” he says.//

//For Suzanense, the issue of work is very complicated: “When companies discover that you are trans, the vacancy magically disappears or they say that you don't need it anymore” she says. She says that the biggest difficulty is acceptance with other employees and the board. “The vast majority of companies still have a very conservative body of directors” comments the singer.//

//About prejudice, she tells of a passage: “Three years ago, when I started the transition process, I was prevented from using a women's dressing room in a store in the city because, at the time, I didn't have a very “feminine” appearance. Security pulled me out of the dressing room and put me through public humiliation with the store full. today I don't buy anything at this store anymore,” he says.//

//The singer is emphatic in saying what needs to be improved for trans and the entire LGBTQI+ community: “The acceptance and understanding of people about us. We are human beings like everyone else. In addition, we also need more visibility on a daily basis” defends Gabriella.//
