> 
> just feel the need to point out how aggressively they have been misegendered and deadnamed in the press. If you're cis and don't see why this is a problem please consider how fucked it is to erase someone's actual lived identity when they are in no position to defend themselves
> 
> It hurts our entire community to watch as people literally erase us after death. Knowing that even in death we're disrespected. Knowing that the minute our voices stop, people will come in and over write our literal existance for their own cis comfort. It's disgusting.
> 
> Seriously, cis people go look at the articles for their missing persons case. There's not even any acknowledgment that they were non-binary, and only cursory hat tips to the name El, which they treated as a nickname. 
> 
> I only know because another researcher hunted down El's social media, and read comments from their chosen family and was alarmed at the erasure and contacted me. 
> This is an extremely common occurrence. Erasing that people are LGBTQ+ in media when they go missing is gross as hell
> 
> It also makes it much harder for our community to support them and their chosen families, and to assist in finding them. And frankly, no one is going to look for our own as hard as we will ourselves.

> Human remains found in California's Yucca Valley have been identified as Lauren Cho, a 30-year-old New Jersey woman who went missing from her Airbnb in June.
> 
> Cho, who friends and family call "El," reportedly walked away from an Airbnb on the 8600 block of Benmar Trail in Yucca Valley on June 28 around 5 p.m. The mountainous area is about a 30-minute drive north of Palm Springs and surrounded by desert hiking trails.
> 
> San Bernardino County Sheriffâ€™s Department spokesperson Mara Rodriguez told Inside Edition that Cho was staying at the rental with a group of friends and reportedly became "upset" over an unspecified issue. She then allegedly walked away from the rental without taking food, water or her phone. Cho was reported missing by her ex-boyfriend about three hours after she walked off, and he indicated Cho may have been in "mental distress," according to police. The sheriff's department has said it does not suspect foul play.
> 
> A search warrant was executed on the Benmar Trail residence July 31, and repeated aerial searches in the "remote mountain terrain near the scene" located human remains on Oct. 9. The location of Cho's remains was described by officials as "rugged terrain of the open desert of Yucca Valley."
> 
> The San Bernardino County Coroner's Division is awaiting results of toxicology tests, and as such are not releasing the cause of death at this time. Cho's family and friends, who run a website and Facebook page called "Find Lauren Cho," said she was "not under the influence of anything at the time of her disappearance."
> 
> A friend told CNN in early October that the New Jersey woman was in California looking for a "fresh start" and had taken the opportunity to do some traveling as the pandemic eased.
> 
> "We want answers. Lauren 'El' Cho is a talented musician, vocalist, chef, baker, artist, photographer, former music educator and former piercing apprentice," her friends said in a statement. "She is the most loving, caring and loyal aunt, sister and friend, and the most hilarious person you could ever meet. And we cannot give up on her."



> Remains found in Southern California are that of Lauren "El" Cho, a New Jersey woman who disappeared in June, officials confirmed Thursday.
> 
> Lauren Cho has been missing since June 28, 2021.
> Lauren Cho disappeared in June.via Morongo Basin Sheriff's Station
> The positive identification brought a sad end to the monthslong search for Cho, a Korean American whose case gained renewed interest during the debate over racial disparities in news media coverage about missing persons.
> 
> "The cause and manner of death is pending toxicology results," according to a statement from the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Office. "No further information will be released on this case until such time toxicology results are available and new information is discovered as a result."
> 
> The human remains were found on Oct. 9 in the rugged, open desert terrain near her last known location, an artist-oriented Airbnb rental in Yucca Valley, about 30 miles north of Palm Springs.
> 
> Authorities had searched the compound and surrounding area several times, according to the San Bernardino County Sheriff.
> 
> The San Bernardino County Sheriff's Specialized Investigation Division became involved in late September after local investigators "exhausted their investigation."
> 
> Cho, 30, was first reported missing at around 5 p.m. on June 28, after friends and others staying at the compound said she departed in a state of agitation with no food, water or phone.
> 
> About a week later, relatives of Cho activated a Facebook page called "Missing Person: Lauren 'El' Cho" to raise awareness about her disappearance.
