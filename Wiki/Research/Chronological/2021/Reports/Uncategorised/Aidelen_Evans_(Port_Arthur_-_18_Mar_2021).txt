24-year-old Transgender woman of color Aidelen Evans was found dead in Port Arthur Texas Sunday, March 18, 2021. Aidelen Evans was a Black trans woman who stood 5 foot 9 inches and weighed 105 pounds.

Police responding to a call at 7:19 pm on March 18 found her dead in a canal running adjacent to the Motova property in the 3700 block of Savannah Ave.

However, due to police deadnaming and misgendering, her death remained unknown to our community until today at 8:00 pm.

Police said the cause of death is unknown and foul play has not been ruled out.

Evans was a homeless trans woman who was known to frequent the College and 4th Street area in Beaumont.

“We are asking if anyone has any information on Aidelen Evans’s last whereabouts or who she might have been last seen with, to please contact the Port Arthur Police Department at 409-983-8600,” a PAPD statement said. *Note the statement has been corrected to identify the deceased correctly.

“You can also contact Crime Stoppers of Southeast Texas at 833-TIPS. You do not have to give your name and could be eligible for a cash reward.”

Community leader Dee Dee Watters, author of TransGriot Weekly will lead a vigil for Aidelen Evans at Central Park (Fannin and 4th ST) on Sunday, March 28th at 6:00 pm. They will say her name and honor her life. #sayhername #blacktranslivematter
