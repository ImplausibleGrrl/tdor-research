> Trans woman Derya (36) was found dead in a car park in Ankara's Sıhhiye on the night of December 4. The cause of her death is being investigated. Speaking to Kaos GL Association, Derya's friends have said that Derya's deceased body was found by the security guards working at the car park. The deceased body of the woman has been sent to the Keçiören Forensic Medicine Institution for a postmortem examination.
> 
> The Pembe Hayat (Pink Life) Association and the Kırmızı Şemsiye (Red Umbrella) Association have released a written statement and announced that they will follow up the investigation into her death.
> 
> The associations have noted, "With her body sent to the forensic medicine institution for an autopsy because 'her death was suspicious', Derya's death is not suspicious. It is without a doubt that Derya was the victim of a 'murder'. It is an undeniable fact that, in our geography, trans people unfortunately wage a fight in conditions of police state and state of emergency."
> 
> Raising concerns about the impunity for the crimes against trans people in Turkey, the associations have briefly added:
> 
> "Besides, when the autopsy reports come out, we may learn that Derya was not killed by someone, but hanged herself, which would not change the fact that Derya was the victim of a murder.
> 
>  Deprived of all types of social and public support mechanisms, systematically deprived of all constitutional rights, excluded from public space, turned into a target of organized evil and violence by the state as well and with their deceased bodies found in a field, a construction site, a car park or a highway not met 'with surprise or awe' by society, trans people's suicides, about the reasons of which we do not think much, but we all know, are murders, even if they are suicides.
> 'Trans murders are political'
> Referring to Ali Gül, another trans, the associations have said that "even though the complications related to cervical cancer were effective in Ali Gül's death, what caused the death of Gül was the denial of the right to healthcare because of Gül being trans, the belated diagnosis of the disease due to the transphobic healthcare system and the obstacles to treatment."
> 
> Moreover, the associations have said, "Who killed Hande Kader is not only the ones who set her body on fire. The media outlets and workers that Hande called to account in her unforgettable video; the transphobic and male justice that did not issue the indictment of the murder for years, let alone putting the perpetrators on trial; and every single person who did not conduct an effective investigation, who did not fulfill their duty because Hande was trans, who paved the way for this murder, covered it up, saw it legitimate and insitgated it are the murderers of Hande."
> 
> Concluding the statement, the associations have said:
> 
> "As can be seen, murder is commited not only by pulling the trigger. The death of every single trans who is condemned to death under our very nose and 'whose deaths we are attempted to get used to and not get surprised at' is a murder. Trans murders are political!" (EMK/SD)



> Derya, a trans woman living in Ankara, was found hanging dead in a parking lot in Ankara's SihhiyDe district on the night of 4 December. The cause of death of 36-year-old trans woman Derya is being investigated.
> 
> According to the information given by Derya's friends; Derya's body was found by security guards working in the parking lot. Derya's body was sent to Keçiören Forensic Medicine Institute for autopsy. 
> 
> Our joint statement as Pembe Hayat LGBTI+ Solidarity Association and Red Umbrella Association:
> 
> Pink Life LGBTI+ Solidarity Association and Red Umbrella Association We will follow up every step of the investigation. In addition, we would like to point out that the death of Derya, whose body was sent to the forensic medicine institution for autopsy on the grounds that it was a "suspicious death", is not suspicious. There is no doubt that Derya was the victim of a "murder". Unfortunately, it is an undeniable reality that trans people in our geography are waging a war under the police state and state of emergency. The elimination of impunity for hate crimes committed against trans people, the punishment of perpetrators they deserve, is essential for social peace and coexistence, and is one of the most burning agendas of our struggle. In addition, when the autopsy reports come out, we can learn that Derya was not killed by someone, but that she hanged herself. This does not change the fact that Derya is the victim of a murder.All their constitutional rights have been systematically usurped by being deprived of all kinds of social and public support mechanisms, excluded from public spaces, made the target of organized evil and violence, including by the state itself, and their bodies are found dead in a field, construction, parking lot or highway. Unfortunately, the suicides of trans people, of whom we are not “surprised or horrified”, which is not a surprise to any of us, the reason we do not think about, but we all know, is homicide, even if it is for this reason.
> 
> Cancer did not kill Ali Gül, who died due to cervical cancer. Yes, the complications resulting from cancer were effective, but the fact that Ali Gül was killed was a trans person, and his right to access to health was prevented, his curable disease was diagnosed too late due to the transphobic healthcare system, and his access to treatment was prevented. 
> 
> Those who killed Hande Kader are not the only ones who set her body on fire. Transphobic media organizations and their employees, to whom Hande is held accountable in her unforgettable video, transphobic and male justice, who did not even prosecute the perpetrators for years, did not even prepare the indictment of the murder, did not carry out an effective investigation, did not fulfill their duties due to Hande's being trans, laid the groundwork for this murder, covered it up, saw it as justified, It is every single person who instigates.
> 
> As you can see, the murder is not committed only by pulling the trigger. The death of every trans person who is blindly left to die and whose death we are "tryed to be accustomed to and not surprised by" is murder.
> 
> TRANS MURDERES ARE POLITICAL!
