Telde regrets the death of the transformist Xayo, found dead in his house
TELDEACTUALITY

Telde.- The Transformer from Gran Canaria Xayo was found dead this Wednesday in his home, located in the Guanarteme neighborhood of the capital. For now they have not transcended the causes of death.

Firefighters and agents of the National Police moved to the building, on Dos de Mayo Street, after it had been weeks without showing signs of life. Upon arriving at the place, the death of the famous artist was confirmed.

According to the National Police, Xayo could have been lifeless for several days, since his body showed signs of decomposition. The artist's own neighbors were the ones who warned the agents about the strong smell that came from the home. Now we are working on trying to clarify the causes of his death although, in principle, a death from violent causes is ruled out

Xayo, a native of the northern municipality of Guía, began in the world of transformism in 1977 and his last major appearance was on the television program Got Talent, on Telecinco, in 2019, where he was recognized by the public.

“The police once took me to the police station. I came out of this story well, but it was screwed up. His family also spoke: "He understood perfectly that I dedicated myself to this ... As long as I maintained the respect that the house deserved, it could be whatever I wanted," the artist recalled about his beginnings.

Telde mourns the death of the artist

The Telde City Council regrets the death of Xayo, a benchmark in transformism and a renowned comedian who collaborated on numerous occasions in the town's festivities.  

The Councilor for Celebrations, Servando González, recalls that Xayo's last collaboration with Telde was during confinement, when he participated in the initiative with #SiempreContigo “with a video in which with his characteristic humor he asked for courage and responsibility to fight against the virus, and shared his illusion of being able to enjoy the holidays soon.

The Teldense Corporation conveys its condolences to the family and friends of this artist from Gran Canaria.
