> Marina literally sacrificed her life for rights and freedoms without discrimination. It was a perfectly conscious choice of hers. With tremendous dignity, she had not revealed to even her closest associates that she had been diagnosed with cancer in April 2021. Because she was proud and didn't want this to interrupt even for a second the goals she had set. Her huge work on rights. That's why she gave her blood.
> 
> Marina Galanou literally changed the lives of thousands of our fellow human beings. It changed everyone's perception of the very concept of gender. "You have to understand that there are women with a bird and men with smudging," he said overtly to a committee at the Ministry of Health, explaining to them that they have to forget what they know. It is the rare case of a man who fought the prejudices of millennia and won them institutionally. Because, very quickly, he realized that perceptions are changing primarily through collectivity, institutions, the democratic process, the rule of law, judicial decisions, legislation. Marina is the most important extra-parliamentary "legislator" that passed through the country. It had drafted on its own, without even the help of a lawyer, dozens of bills, amendments, ministerial decisions, circulars on rights, some of which are already state laws and regulatory administrative acts! I have not met another activist so dedicated to regulating freedom, through legislative intervention and healthy, transparent rightful lobbying.
> 
> In 2004 Marina founded the first exclusively gay, lesbian and trans (then) bookstore and publishing house in Athens. The Colorful Planet. This, in those years by Greek standards, was an extremely bold move, in all respects: business, economic, but also socially, culturally. At that time, LGBTQ+ marketing in Athens was sold out exclusively at the gay bars in Gazi. The Colorful Planet published books on LGBTQ rights at a time when the concept did not exist well – well. She was proud when parents visited the place to find suitable books to better understand their children. When they came to be informed about the rights. When LGBTQI writers entrusted their works to her publishing house because they knew that nowhere else would they find a home and while she knew how foolhardy this was for her. At the same time, she herself had as a writer to present a remarkable number of books, all about rights. She was very interested in being able to inform, in simple terms, all the people who can be helped in practical ways to exercise their rights. He was a scholarly person, but not at all sterile. He turned aside the obsession with misery, adherence to marginality and fatalism. That's why he made the Colorful Planet.
> 
> Marina ran in those years and actively contributed to giving the first asylum to a gay Iranian refugee, the first asylum given by the Hellenic Republic due to sexual orientation! This after many years was enshrined as a special reason for asylum in Greek law. It was one of the first roads it opened up, a road that saved the lives of people who, if they lived in their countries, would be awaited by the death penalty. She has written it all in her book "LGBTQI Refugees in Greece" released in July 2021.
> 
> In 2010 Marina along with many other transgender people founded the Transgender Support Association. He had also been a general secretary in a much earlier fraternal effort (at that time when the term was "transvestite – transgender") that had long since langgished. From the beginning, she had in mind to form the S.Y.D. as an organization with intense political intervention, with visits to ministries, with interventions in Parliament, in public life and in the co-formation of legislation. By participating in trials that would recognize new rights and lead to the formation of a new concept of freedom about gender, gender identity, sexuality.
> 
> From the very first year, the S.Y.D. organized the Day of Remembrance of Trans Victims, an event with a strong element of the workshop, where it always invited both politicians and MPs to bring them into direct contact with the trans community, its problems and to extract commitments for legislative solutions. "I want to have the politicians there, to listen to everything," he said, but at the same time he was a cerberus so that no one from the public would ever attack them. Some of us once lost our temper in this difficult part of the event and it was the first to bring us back to order. That night I was almost disciplined! She wanted to be able to be able to be a speaker with MPs as a SYD, so that she could pass the Community's demands by law.
> 
> Marina was the one responsible for the very application of "legal recognition of gender identity" in Greece. He had identified precisely the case of the child who had all those characteristics to be the inaugural case, long before of course the law itself changed. The case of the person who experiences his gender identity as a male, without having undergone surgery, while when he was born he was assigned the female sex. Claiming from the State the legal change of his data, according to the gender identity. At the time, not even the European Court of Human Rights had accepted this. However, the Justice of the Peace of Athens accepted it in this case. In the case that Marina decided she was the decisive one for this matter. The court used her own book "Gender Identity and Expression: Terminology, Discrimination, Stereotypes and Myths" (SYD, 2014), with all the analysis of correct terminology that she shed light on new concepts at a time when these were only theory. Following this decision, the legislator was activated, who proceeded to institutionalize the procedure. Until then, there was only the judicial activism of Marina and some enlightened judges of the Justice of the Peace of Athens.
> 
> Marina's image in the Parliament gallery when the law on the legal recognition of gender identity was passed in 2017 was the portrait of the historic victory. With all the mistakes made by the legislator of Law 4491/2017, which Marina had identified one by one. Marina was officially the first trans woman member of a legislative committee (but without a vote), along with university professors and jurists! An incredible success. In less than ten years, the SYD had achieved its most important legislative objective. Completely overturning the perception of gender for millennia, through the leading state body, the Greek Parliament!
> 
> No other activist in Greece has achieved this. No other human rights association or organisation has reached such a point of institutional effectiveness, with such a subversive content. Long before many other European countries, long before the USA.
> 
> However, marina and SYD's footprint on the legislation is not limited to this peak moment of 2017. Long before, with her own intervention and perseverance, in more difficult years she persuaded a minister of justice to put the (then unknown) concept of "gender identity" in the Penal Code! As an aggravating circumstance for a crime, so that the offender is punished more severely when choosing his victim because of his gender identity (transphobic crime). But also in the anti-racist legislation (2014), in the cohabitation agreement (2015), in the law on equal treatment without discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity or characteristics (2016). Many more pieces of legislation bear the traces of Marina and the intervention of the SYD.
> 
> In Vouli, when she was called to committees, she did not need to show her identity card at the entrance. An identity that went last of almost all known trans to change it. Because she was not interested in herself, but first to offer to all the other people. To organize food supply, to gather help for people who literally did not have a fate in the sun. To run for the refugees. To find doctors and lawyers for people in danger. To stand in hospitals next to people who had no one.
> 
> Marina could have been the first trans member of the Greek Parliament. She denied it, because she was not at all concerned with the concept of office. As she said ,"I don't do politics, I do activism". He was completely consistent in this: he had to be able to beat them all, no matter how close they were "politically" or "ideologically" to her. He would never be helped in an opportunity chair or in an honorary position. When he became the first trans member of the National Commission on Human Rights, he only came in to achieve the institutional changes that the LGBTQ rights agenda included. Marina has worked exhaustively for E.E.D.A. We have spent endless hours together drafting observations and proposals for legislation, for new laws, for regulatory acts, so that they all include correct provisions in LGBTQ rights.
> 
> She was the first to organise human rights seminars, in her capacity as an Expert of the Council of Europe, in places where trans rights had never before been analysed, such as the police, judges and the Bar Association. She went herself, a trans among dozens of police officers sitting like good students at their desks, to teach them that they must respect gender identity! She explained to them how they should call her. He had them "souza" throughout the seminar.
> 
> In 2019, he led a working group set up at the Ministry of Health on transgender people's access to health services. This is the first finding of a state commission that supported the lifting of the ban on blood donation for LGBTQ+ people, a finding that unfortunately has been in the drawers of the Ministry since then. Marina from the first meeting had come with the bill ready. He did not want to waste our time on endless debates, he did have a legislative solution to all the problems ready. A diamond bill that resolved everything related to its subject, with tremendous deepening and huge scope.
> 
> Having travelled all this vast journey, he was sure to be chosen by the Prime Minister to be a member of the LGBTQ+ Equality Strategy Drafting Committee. As a member of this committee, Marina did not have a good time at all. She insisted too much, against narrow-minded and academic notions of LGBTQ+ rights, and exerted enormous pressure even putting her resignation on the table. She was disappointed after each meeting, but she succeeded with her insistence on including in the final report a large part of what had initially been rejected. But not all of them, and certainly not with the wording that he would have liked, that is, the clear and unconditional wording of the resolutions of the Council of Europe that he has always invoked. All this time she felt that she was the only member who was actually working on the National LGBTQ+ Equality Strategy and every time, before and after every meeting we talked to by phone, she was outraged and exhausted. Her last public appearance was in the commemorative photo at the Maximos Mansion, along with the other members of the committee. At the end of June 2021, the day they handed over the report to the Prime Minister, with the main demand for the establishment of same-sex marriage. Next to Kyriakos Mitsotakis are depicted herself and the president of the committee and then everyone else.
> 
> Her major achievement last September was that trans people were finally included in the Ministry of Labour in the groups that when hired subsidized employers. It was very moving to post a trans woman who wrote that she hung up the heels of sex work which was the only job she could do, because thanks to this decision she was able to be hired as a saleswoman in a shop. This was a great success of the SYD and Marina who insisted on the inclusion of trans people in the relevant ministerial decision.
> 
> Her final concern was to propose amendments to the changes to the Penal Code. I was very concerned about her health, especially after June. He had told me he had anemia. That he was waiting for exams. That she was very tired. It hadn't even crossed my mind. Her dignity would never allow her to say anything at all. Even to such a close partner and friend. He didn't want to worry anyone. It would forbid a hint of compassion or even a tear. He entered hippocrates three days ago. Her departure had already begun. He had given it his all. He had everything and nothing.
> 
> She was Saint Marina.
> 
> It changed for the better the lives of many, many other fellow human beings. This is the only thing worth having as a purpose in life.




> The activist and president of the Transgender Support Association (SYD), Marina Galanou, passed away.
> 
> She was the founder of The Colorful Planet and creator of the site t-zine.gr. She was born in Piraeus where she lived most of her life. She began working on activism shortly after the mid-90s, following incidents in which she was discriminated against as a trans woman— particularly in her business.
> 
> "In 2001, the first transgender collective, the Transvestite Transgender Solidarity Association of Greece (SATTE), came to fruition and began to be established. I was secretary-general there. There was, at the time, intense activity in matters of education, police arbitrariness and health, in many fields," they recounted in 2020 to LiFO.
> 
> In 2004 he was forced to leave, for personal reasons, but continued to be active. In 2006, when the president of the Greek Gay Community, Vangelis Gianellos, passed away, he became its general secretary until 2008. Then followed the Transgender Support Association (SYD), as, in the meantime, satte had ceased to exist and the need to create a targeted trans collective was born.
> 
> The SYD was founded in March 2010 by 23 founding members. In 2020, it already had about 200 members all over Greece, with many individual secretariats for specialized legal and psychological support issues, on issues of racism, discrimination, recording of incidents, on sex work issues, intersex of people, LGBTQ+ refugees, while there is a regional secretariat for trans people living outside Athens.
> 
> The Colorful Planet,the first LGBTQI+ publishing house and bookstore in Greece, was created in 2004 "and the decision to establish it came the same day I left SATTE", he explained to LiFO.
> 
> "I felt that I left activism behind me - very temporarily of course - but that this could be the starting point for something equally substantial, with a strong political message: to highlight the richness of the culture of diversity, especially prose and poetry with LGBTQ+ thematic.
> 
> "Although the difficulties along the way were many, especially during the period of economic crisis, the Colorful Planet achieved some goals. At first it was difficult to put our books on the shelves, when we rented our office we were threatened with eviction, because some residents wanted to collect signatures, while I cannot say that there was substantial support from the community. Nevertheless, we are here and we continue."
> 
> In Greece we have a deep problem of institutionalized racism emanating from public and political figures, unfortunately also within the Greek Parliament, and from ecclesiastical factors. If we do not deal with this, it will be chasing us. The trans community, of course, is one of the social groups that have suffered the most racism and its members suffer daily abuse, even within the LGBTQ+ community itself. This is expressed in all reports by international and European organisations. We cannot say that we are in the same place as 20 or 10 years ago. Of course the situation is better, steps have been taken, but if we want to talk about trans visibility, let's ask ourselves how many times we have seen a trans person in some public service, in a bank, in a post, somewhere, serving us."
