> Trans men found dead in Caravelas used fake name
> Civil Police will investigate the reasons for “Jota” to use the data of his sister who lives in the state of Paraíba
> Jota officially identified herself as Maria do Socorro, but this name would belong to her sister
> In addition to the cause of death not yet clarified, the Civil Police will also investigate the reasons that led a trans man, known as "Jota", to use his sister's name in his personal documents. Maria do Socorro da Conceição de Sousa, found dead in her apartment last Friday (21), was actually Magna da Conceição de Sousa, 39, sister of Maria do Socorro. The discovery of this imbroglio occurred in the morning of this Sunday (23).
> 
> The Diário do Aço found out with the delegate Marcelo Franco Marino, on duty at the 1st Regional Civil Police Station, that Jota's girlfriend went to the Civil Police because of a problem she discovered. Maria do Socorro was actually Magna da Conceição, even the young woman took a copy of her birth certificate with the name that would be the trans boyfriend.
> 
> Maria's data can be found in the driver's license that Jota used. Through this document, the civil police officers, when they pulled their name in the Civil Police data system, discovered that the trans man had been arrested in 2018 for illicit drug trafficking and was collected for about five months at Ceresp in Ipatinga.
> 
> The delegate informed that an inquiry has been opened and the case will be investigated. Maria do Socorro, who lives in Paraíba, should be heard by letter-precatory to explain the situation to the Civil Police to find out the reasons that her sister used her data in Minas Gerais.
> 
> In addition to this case of misrepresentation, the cause of Jota's death is also investigated by the Civil Police.The trans man was found by his girlfriend, already lifeless, in his apartment on Rua Chapecó, in the Caravelas neighborhood, on Friday afternoon (21) . He was locking the room, the door opened by a key ring hired by the 29-year-old woman who was dating until then “Maria da Conceição”.
> 
> The police located at Jota's apartment about a kilo of cocaine in bars and smaller portions, in addition to R $ 500, precision scales and other objects collected. Jota's body was sent to the Medical-Legal Institute (IML) of Ipatinga and necropsied.
> 
> The cause of death was not revealed and a sample of body parts will be sent to Belo Horizonte to carry out more detailed tests and try to identify what caused Jota's death. Because of the problems with identification, the funeral that was scheduled for the end of this Sunday morning will be on Monday (24).
> 
> What is a trans man
> Magna da Conceição, despite being born a woman, she identified herself as a man and even, through hormones, she presented herself with a masculine body. A well-known trans man today is Thammy Gretchen. But what is a trans man? According to the definition of the Transcendemos website, the term trans is used to refer to a person who does not identify with the gender to which he was assigned at his birth.
> 
> When we are born, our genders are determined by our sex. Thus, a person who is born with a penis is considered as a man and a person who is born with a vagina, as a woman. However, some people realize that they identify with another gender and start living as they wish and feel better about themselves.
> 
> In this way, we can use “trans woman” or “transfeminine person” to refer to someone who has been designated a man, but who understands herself as a female figure. The term “trans man” or “transmasculine person” is used to refer to a person who has been designated a woman, but who identifies himself with a personal masculine image.

> According to Maria do Socorro's girlfriend, the two had been together for seven years and around 2 am on Friday they were together when Maria left. The young woman said that they spent a few hours in a motel on Thursday where they used alcohol. The witness said he saw his girlfriend using cocaine, but did not agree with her attitude and threw out the narcotic.
> 
> She added that days ago the girlfriend gave a copy of the key to the door to her apartment. The goal would be to verify the location if he was unable to contact. These attitudes and the disappearance of Maria do Socorro for hours caused concern to the young woman who was unable to return messages on WhatsApp and the phone was turned off.

The expertise of the Civil Police was called and found no signs of violence in Maria's body, which was sent to the Legal Medical Institute (IML) of Ipatinga so that the tests can indicate the cause of death.
> 
> The young woman saw that the girlfriend's cell phone, found on the bed, was reset and without any message when she turned on the device. She was responsible for personal property in Maria's apartment, as the victim's family members live in the state of Paraíba, as reported to Sergeant Jarbas' team responsible for recording the occurrence.
> 
> However, to the surprise of the military police, a backpack was located in the victim's room and, inside it, a large tablet and 18 smaller portions of cocaine, totaling almost a kilo of the drug, in addition to R $ 554, an amount that is suspected to be from trafficking.
