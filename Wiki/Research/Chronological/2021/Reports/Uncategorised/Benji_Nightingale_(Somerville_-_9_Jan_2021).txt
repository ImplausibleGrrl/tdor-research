Benji was born on November 5th 1986 in Ireland. During their time in Ireland, Benji spent many days with their friends, listening to music and finding themself. At 17, Benji received a scholarship to the University of Miami. After many years in Miami, Benji relocated to Cambridge, MA. During their time here, Benji was a successful DJ who played shows for many prominent venues. Benji was a passionate defender of LGBT rights, for the rights of ALL people. Benji worked for a construction company in Boston where they excelled at their job. They had many friends, but mostly led a quiet life. If they weren’t out on a walk, they were at home, listening to music and browsing the Internet, taking selfies and “smoking all the pot”. Benji was truly a generous, kind soul who wanted to best for everyone, even if it meant them sacrificing things for themself. 


Benji was laid to rest at Mt. Benedict Cemetery in West Roxbury, MA (visit B Palmer on Find-a-Grave). However, Benji’s wish was to be cremated and have their ashes scattered at the Isle of Skye.



> Benji Palmer was found unresponsive in his residence on January 9, 2021 and later died, and has been listed as unclaimed since then. Benji was seeking asylum in the United States and the Massachusetts Medical Examiner’s Office was unable to locate next of kin from whom they have been estranged. On November 15, 2021 TDTF was able to locate Benji’s chosen family and location of unmarked interment and provide a space for those who loved Benji to remember them.
