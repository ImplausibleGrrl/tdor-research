We were contacted on October 10, 2021 to help locate the next of kin for a lovely Trans woman, Calandrea Carmichael who passed away the day before in Georgia. We were able to make contact with the local coroner and facilitate communications to ensure that Calandrea did not become an unclaimed person. The person who contacted us found Calandreaâ€™s brother, and the family was notified.
