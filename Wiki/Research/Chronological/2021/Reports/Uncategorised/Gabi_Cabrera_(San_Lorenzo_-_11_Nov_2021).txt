> Activists and human rights organizations demand investigation and justice for the death of Gabi Cabrera
> The young trans woman, Gabriela Cabrera, 23, died under circumstances that have not yet been clarified by the Paraguayan Justice. The first hypothesis that the forensic doctor threw was that it was a suicide but his companions from Casa Diversa demand a thorough investigation by the Prosecutor's Office and that justice be done.

> The 23-year-old transgender girl, Gabriela Cabrera, was found dead on Thursday, November 11, on the banks of the San Lorenzo stream, located on calles Saturio Ríos and Fortín Arce in the city of San Lorenzo. Gabi , as her relatives affectionately called her, was a volunteer at Casa Diversa, the first home in Paraguay for LGBT victims of violence. She arrived in March of this year when six men kidnapped her, beat her and tortured her inside a vehicle , and then threw her into the San Lorenzo stream. 
> 
> Eight months later, the police find her dead in the same place. Her neighbors saw Gabi on the ground with a man crying over her motionless body. At 10:00 in the morning, they notified both the human rights activist, Yren Rotela and the family, and they went together to identify the body of the young transgender woman. According to Rotela, the person who was sleeping next to Gabi's lifeless body is Reinaldo Manuel Fernández Gonzalez, her 25-year-old partner. 
> 
> The prosecution ordered Reinaldo's arrest and an investigatory statement was taken from him, but he was detained for less than six hours. In communication with Presentes , the prosecutor Gerardo Mosqueira said that they did not detain him because they did not gather enough evidence to do so. "We cannot accuse just to impute, we have to have elements to support an accusation," he said. 
> 
> However, Reinaldo stated that before finding her dead, they had had an argument. That he left her for ten minutes and that, when he returned, he found her lifeless, with a rope wrapped around her neck very close to a tree. “He told us that Gabi hung herself from the tree. That they were together, then he left the place and that when he returned he already found Gabi hanging by the tree. Then, from the fright, he jumped over it and there the rope was released and they fell to the ground together and fell asleep. That was the scene that we found, ”says Mosqueira. 
> 
> The prosecutor indicated that the forensic doctor determined in a preliminary way that it could be a case of suicide, but to determine the real cause of death, the body was subjected to an autopsy. "Last Friday the autopsy was carried out and the result will be in two or three weeks, where it will be possible to determine whether it was a suicide or not," adds Mosqueira. His family and loved ones demanded that the case be thoroughly investigated. 
> 
> For Yren it is not clear that it is a suicide. He is struck by the fact that everything happened in a period of 10 minutes, that the rope broke when they fell to the ground together and that Gabi's body did not have any blows. Yren saw her for the last time on Tuesday afternoon the 9th. On that occasion, he asked him how he was and Gabi told him that he had injuries, that some men beat him on the weekend. “They humiliated me a lot,” he told Yren, who noticed that Gabi was limping on one leg. He also told her that her head hurt, a fact that Mónica, a health promoter for the Panambí Association, confirmed. 
> 
> "Mother, I'm leaving on Friday and I'll stay until Sunday because that day Paola Cacho comes back with everything," Gabi told her, referring to her parents' house. Paola Cacho is an artistic character that she created for the Diversas program that they have on Sundays with Casa Diversa. “She tells me that and I keep that version. I did not see her saddened. What's more, I asked him how he was and he said fine. Only afterwards did he tell me that they beat him, ”says Yren.

> Gabi was part of the cast of Transforming Realities .

> Regarding the place, Mosqueira said: “What happens is that they are a couple and they are going to live there. According to his mother, he lived there for three months and did not even return home much. She only told me that she went out to work at night and that she was always with her boyfriend. As long as we do not have the result of the autopsy it is difficult to know ”. 
> 
> Attempted transfemicide 
> 
> On Saturday 13, Yren published on her social networks two videos recorded at dawn on Saturday, November 6, four days before Gabi's lifeless appearance, in which she is clearly seen being attacked by a group of men at the exit of a bowling alley in San Lorenzo. "On Friday those images come to me," says Yren, "when I make Gabi's death public, the people who recorded the video write to me on my social networks." 
> 
> Gabi practiced sex work on the corner of one of the nightclubs and frequented that location. One of the people who contacted Yren with the images of that night says that, for fun, they throw a loaded champagne bottle at him and then a glass of chopp directly at his head. "That is the one I see later when we meet days later. Then, she reacts because she felt hurt and starts throwing bottles in the middle of the road. At that moment, one of the bottles crosses and it is said that it was through a windshield ”, he says. 
> 
> There is another version that says that those same people who threw the glass at him are the ones who later went to hit him. A third version that reaches Yren maintains that one of the bottles almost reached a girl and, among five men, they beat Gabi, then more people joined to continue attacking her. All versions agree that it was varixs who beat her unconscious. 
> 
> One of the people who shared the video with Yren told her that he desperately called 911 and they never came. He was lying on the ground for more than an hour. In the video, only a woman in a black shirt is seen pushing away the people who beat her and running Gabi out of the way. “She was beaten by more than 10 people for 20 minutes. Those who were inside one of the clubs filmed and gave me the video. And there were security guards who saw everything and did not defend Gabi, ”says the activist. 
> 
> “I know what it feels like to feel humiliated. What Gabi went through, many of us have gone through and we have healed ourselves. I held on in that corner for a long time. Today I have to go out to report, I can't keep quiet. If the disco turned off the music and someone said into the microphone: 'stop, stop, let's call the police', the story would have been different. It cannot be that as a society we remain silent because she was a trans. If Gabi didn't die, this would never come to light, ”Yren said.
> 
> According to the prosecutor Mosqueira, this case has no connection with Gabi's death. “This fact was also denounced but I clarify that it has nothing to do with his death because the coup would have occurred on November 6, although we do not know the exact date. Gabi's body when he was found that Thursday had no traces of blows. That is identified by the forensic doctor, "he said. 
> 
> The prosecutor in charge of this case is Viviana Riveros. According to the Public Ministry, after the blow that Gabi received on Saturday, he received medical assistance and then went home. Riveros said that they have some closed circuits and that they are looking for witnesses to the fact that they must give an investigatory statement in the coming days. The publication of the Ministry says: "Death in these circumstances is investigated in order to determine if it has been the consequence of acts of previous violence." 
> 
> Since Sunday, the hashtag #JusticiaParaGabi is trending on Twitter. The users ask for a clarification of the circumstances in which Gabi Cabrera died. Casa Diversa, the TLGBI Coalition and the Paraguayan Feminist Platform, in charge of organizing and convening the March 8 and November 25 marches, demand an “exhaustive investigation” to elucidate the circumstances of his death and that “it does not become one more statistic of impunity ”. 
> 
> The Human Rights Advisory Commission of the Senate issued a statement on Monday afternoon in which it repudiated the acts of violence that transpired in recent weeks. “The LGBTI population is a daily victim of discrimination and violence in various spheres, preventing the enjoyment or exercise of their rights on equal terms. It is necessary to demonstrate with facts and actions the will of the State to ensure compliance with the rights enshrined in the Constitution and the laws, and to protect even more zealously those most vulnerable groups and those at risk ”, they refer.
> 
> Gabi liked to dance and act. She was part of the artistic cast of Transforming realities under the acting direction of Omar Mareco and was in charge of the garden of Casa Diversa. If it is a transfemicide, there would be 63 murders of trans people in democratic transition in Paraguay. In October 2019, the Paraguayan justice condemned a transfemicide for the first time , the other 61 went unpunished.
