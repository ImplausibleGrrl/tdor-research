The skeletal remains of Santiago Cancinos were found in Vaqueros, Salta (Argentina) on 3 Jun 2021 alongside National Route 9 near the La Caldera river. He had been missing since 16 May 2017 after disappearing on the way to school.

> Yesterday afternoon, a man was occasionally driving along National Route 9 when he found skeletal remains on the side of the road, at kilometer 12.5 near the La Caldera river in the town of Vaqueros, Salta. He immediately called the police, who arrived shortly afterwards. Throughout the night, investigators worked under the hypothesis that it could be Santiago Cancinos, the 14-year-old trans boy who had been missing since May 16, 2017.
> 
> The confirmation came this Friday: from the Public Prosecutor's Office of Salta they communicated that the remains indeed belong to the minor, of whom nothing had been heard for more than four years.
> 
> The criminal prosecutors Mónica Poma and Santiago López Soto and the director of the CIF, Pablo Rivero, indicated that the dental expertise determined a 100% match. The same was carried out with the dental records of Cancinos, granting certainty of his identity. On the other hand, some articles of clothing, despite their deteriorated condition, were recognized by the teenager's parents. In the next few days a genetic comparison will be carried out in order to finish verifying his identity.
> 
> In the statement, prosecutors referred to the minor by his birth name, [deadname] Cancinos. This is how it appeared on the website of the Missing Children organization and also on the official page of disappeared persons of the national government, which came to offer a reward of one and a half million pesos for anyone who provided information on their whereabouts. Prosecutors clarified that he was mentioned according to his legal name at the time of the disappearance, without ignoring the validity of the Gender Identity Law, in relation to his self-perception. For Javier Cancino, Santiago's father, the name was indifferent: he just wanted to find his son.
> 
> The discovery took place in an area that is very difficult to access, since it is a slope of more than 80 degrees and covered by weeds. It is located a few kilometers from the Bicentennial Park, where the minor had been last seen.
> 
> On the afternoon of May 16, 2017, Cancinos said goodbye to his father to go to a physical education class at the Belgrano school in the capital of Salta. The man offered to take him to school in the car, located relatively close to the house, in the macro-center of the capital of Salta. Santiago said no, he wanted to go on his own. The father insisted but there was no case. They greeted each other and were never together again.

The cause of Santiago's death has not yet been determined. Current hypotheses include suicide and murder.
