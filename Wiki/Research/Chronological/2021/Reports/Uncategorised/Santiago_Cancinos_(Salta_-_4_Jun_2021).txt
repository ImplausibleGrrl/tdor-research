The skeletal remains of Santiago Cancinos were found in Vaqueros, Salta (Argentina) on 4 Jun 2021 alongside National Route 9 near the La Caldera river.  He had been missing since 16 May 2017 after disappearing on the way to school.

The cause of his death has not yet been determined.


> Commotion in Salta: they found the body of a trans teenager who had disappeared four years ago

> Yesterday afternoon, a man was occasionally driving along National Route 9 when, at kilometer 12.5 , near the La Caldera river and in the Vaqueros town of Salta, he found skeletal remains on the side of the road. He immediately gave notice to the police, who shortly after mounted an operation in the place. Throughout the night, the investigators toyed with the hypothesis that it could be Santiago Cancinos , the 14-year-old trans boy who had been missing since May 16, 2017 .
> 
> The confirmation came this Friday: from the Public Prosecutor's Office of Salta they communicated that the remains indeed belong to the minor of whom nothing was known for more than four years.
> 
> The criminal prosecutors Mónica Poma and Santiago López Soto and the director of the CIF, Pablo Rivero , indicated that the dental expertise determined a 100% match . The same was carried out with the dental records of Cancinos, granting certainty of his identity. On the other hand, some articles of clothing, despite their deteriorated condition, were recognized by the teenager's parents . Anyway, in the next few days a genetic comparison will be carried out in order to finish scientifically establishing his identity.
> 
> In the statement, prosecutors referred to the minor by his birth name, Gala Cancinos . This is how it appeared on the website of the Missing Children organization and also on the official page of disappeared persons of the national government, which came to offer a reward of one and a half million pesos for anyone who provided information on their whereabouts. Prosecutors clarified that he was mentioned according to his legal name at the time of the disappearance, without ignoring the validity of the Gender Identity Law, in relation to his self-perception . For Javier Cancino , Santiago's father, the name was indifferent: he just wanted to find his son.
> 
> The minor was also searched with the name that was registered at birth
> The discovery took place in an area that is very difficult to access, since it is a slope of more than 80 degrees and covered by weeds. It is located a few kilometers from the Bicentennial Park, where the minor had been last seen.
> 
> On the afternoon of May 16, 2017, Cancinos said goodbye to his father to go to a physical education class at the Belgrano school in the capital of Salta. The man offered to take him to school in the car, located relatively close to the house, in the macro-center of the capital of Salta. Santiago said no, he wanted to go on his own. The father insisted but there was no case. They greeted each other and were never together again.

> “Yo estaba viajando ese día a Buenos Aires para hacer una maestría. Más tarde llamé para ver si había llegado. Después de educación física tenía clase de inglés en un instituto. Entonces supuse que ya tendría que haber llegado a casa. Pero no había vuelto. Pensé que era normal, que se había quedado con amigos. Cuando me estaba por subir al avión llamé a la escuela de inglés y me dijeron que no había ido. La llamé a una compañera del colegio que vive en la cuadra en la que vivimos y me dijo que tampoco había ido a la clase de educación de gimnasia. Me comunico con Mónica, la mamá de Gala, y me dice que viajara tranquilo a Buenos Aires que ella se encargaba. Llegué a Buenos Aires a medianoche, llamé de vuelta y nada. Nunca imaginamos que íbamos a pasar por esto”, relató Javier.
> 
> Javier no lo dudó. Tomó un avión casi de inmediato, volvió a Salta e hizo la denuncia. Según denunció, la acción de la policía provincial en ese momento no fue la esperada. Tardaron en reaccionar y activar la búsqueda de Santiago. “Nunca se fijaron en los accesos de la ciudad si vieron a un menor. Nada. En un principio se recibieron miles de llamados. La fiscalía Penal 2 de Salta se hizo cargo de la investigación pero no dio resultados. Se hicieron rastrillajes, pero no sirvieron de nada. Un año y medio después la causa se reactivó y hubo un cambio de fiscal, que amplió la zona de la búsqueda, pero tampoco hubo resultados”, lamentó.

The investigators of the disappearance handled three hypotheses: a possible suicide, a probable case of human trafficking or an escape from home (this is how the file was qualified). The investigation continues.

> On the afternoon of May 16, 2017, Santiago Cancinos , a trans young man then 14 years old, said goodbye to his father to go to a physical education class at the Belgrano school in the capital of Salta. He left his house as he usually did and since then his whereabouts have been a mystery. There is not a single trace. Four years have already passed, the family's desperation to find him does not give up and the researchers' responses so far are insufficient .
> 
> "It 's as if the earth had swallowed him," he told Infobae Javier Cancinos, Santiago's father, whom his father called him by his birth name, Gala. For a few months he has also been searching under the name ofSantiago, a name by which many knew his daughter. “They told me on social media to look for her like Santiago. So I prefer to call it that to see if I can find it. Just like me today I don't care if you want to call yourself Santiago, Juan, Gala or whatever . I just want him to appear, to tell me that he is fine and nothing more, ”said the father, still hopeful despite the time that passed without any concrete clue.
> 
> On the Facebook page created by Javier to receive information about the whereabouts, he named his son with the name with which he was legally registered when he was born. In turn, the site of the organization Missing Children also looks for it under the same name and even the national government, on its official page of missing persons, offers a reward of one and a half million pesos “for those who provide data that allow to find Constanza Gala Cancinos ”. "It's the least of it," Cancinos relativized.

Santiago said no, he wanted to go on his own. The father insisted but there was no case . They greeted each other and were never together again . "He came to the corner and waved and I haven't seen him since," he described.
> 
> “I was traveling that day to Buenos Aires to do a master's degree. Then I called to see if it had arrived.After physical education I had an English class at a high school. So I figured I should have made it home by now. But he hadn't come back. I thought it was normal, that he had stayed with friends. When I was about to get on the plane, I called the English school and they told me that I had not gone. I called a classmate who lives on the block we live in and she said she hadn't been to gymnastics education class either . I communicate with Mónica, Gala's mother, and she tells me to travel quietly to Buenos Aires, which she was in charge of. I arrived in Buenos Aires at midnight, called back and nothing. We never imagined that we were going to go through this, ”Javier said.

> Javier did not hesitate. He took a plane almost immediately, returned to Salta and made the complaint. According to the complaint, the action of the provincial police at that time was not what was expected. They were slow to react and activate the search for Santiago. “ They never looked at the entrances to the city. If they saw a minor. Nothing. At first thousands of calls were received. The Criminal Prosecutor 2 of Salta took over the investigation but did not produce results . Raking was done but it was of no use. A year and a half later, the case was reactivated and there was a change of prosecutor, which expanded the search area, but there were no results, "he lamented.
> 
> The case today is in the hands of the prosecutor Ramiro Ramos Ossorio, after being instructed by Justo Alberto Vaca. As detailed by Santiago's father, the hypotheses that have been handled so far area possible suicide, a probable case of human trafficking, or an escape from home. The latter is the grade that the file receives for now. There were rakes in most of the city. They looked for him in the vicinity of the Wierna River, in Vaqueros, in the Lesser lands, adjacent to Route 28, but nothing . Garments were found on a hill, where the parents were summoned, but they did not correspond to Santiago. With the passage of time the investigation was diluted.
> 
> A video and a mysterious change of clothes in the park
> 
> Shortly after Santiago's disappearance, a sister-in-law of Javier contacted him to tell him that afternoon, around 4:00 pm, she had seen him in the Bicentennial Park , a place very chosen by young people to walk and play sports. He told him that he had greeted him and that the contact ended there.
> 
> The images of the security cameras of the Park, a green lung and of important dimensions, reflected almost the only certain clue that we have of the adolescent. As revealed by Javier, the boy spent 12 minutes and left.But with a peculiarity: he no longer had on his physical education clothes, jeans, a black sweatshirt and one of the caps that he used to wear..
> 
> 
> “I was carrying the backpack and I was in gym clothes. I thought that in the backpack it was the one of the English classes. That's why I never suspected. My sister-in-law was not struck either because the boys go to that place to get together. There was nothing unusual. From then on, the trail was lost , ”said Cancinos.
> 
> The file today has at least five bodies: all schoolmates and neighbors were interviewed but the data provided was null. Tours were made near the school to see if any other camera provided data but did not have the desired effect either .
> 
> There were some signs prior to the disappearance that when looking at them from a distance and after four years they regain another meaning. The father recalled an argument that Santiago and his mother had shortly before the day of the disappearance. "Monica was always stricter in controlling tasks and her things. She told him that he had to do the activities properly and that at home they had to do things as the parents said. In the discussion, Monica told him that she would never be better in a place other than the house and there Santiago replied: 'And how do you know?' As if wanting to insinuate that suddenly he was already planning to leave the house. As if someone had proposed to leave the house or something. But it is an issue that we think about today . At that time it was a discussion with a teenager who did not grow up, "said the father.
> 
> When the search began, many wrote to Javier to stop looking for her as Gala and to focus on the name of Santiago. In this regard, the father recalled that the issue of her gender and what her daughter felt about it was discussed in the family at some time, but never in a profound way.
> 
> "She went to the school psychologist. He didn't tell us much about it. He also used social networks to communicate and express himself there.At that time we took it as a rebellious adolescent. Since he was going to therapy, we thought he was staying there. For me the psychologist was disastrous because she never told us anything. He never warned us to support him otherwise. But he didn't , ”he questioned.
> 
> Santiago was a fervent follower of a Uruguayan trans influencer named Pedro Puñales, who to date has more than 333,000 followers on Instagram alone . It was precisely he who, in one of his stories last January, surprised everyone and said not to look for him as Gala but as Santiago. It caused a stir that reached Javier's own ears.

> "Gala was a follower of this Puñales and other youtubers as well. In fact once, several of these boys came to the house and Gala asked them to bring her a gift that she had especially bought for this boy, ”revealed the father, who in the middle of the conversation alternates between the name with which the knew and his identity as a male. “ The thing is that in his stories he said that Santiago had run away from home and there everyone started writing to me. I remember telling Gala not to follow those pages, that they didn't add anything to her. He ignored me , ”he recalled. Another disturbing fact is that Santiago had at least eight profiles on social networks. Javier doesn't know why but he thinks it was so that they, as parents, couldn't track what he was doing and could partly explain his decision to leave home and never come back.
> 
> “I no longer know what to do. I even went to see healers and they all tell me that he is alive and that he is in the country. I just want him to show up and tell me that he's fine and that he doesn't need anything else, ”Javier concluded.
> 
> Javier does not dare to give an accurate hypothesis about the whereabouts of his son. He believes that at first he left home because he did not feel supported by his gender choice. Remember that the school that Santiago attended is religious and very conservative and that suddenly that could influence him to escape. The man slipped in the midst of emotion that perhaps he was not given the attention he might have needed at the time. The same thing that matters "is that it gives a sign of life." In addition, he expressed this in a message written on his Facebook profile on May 17, when it was a new anniversary of the day he saw him for the last time.
> 
> "Sorry, sorry for what you have missed at home. I want you to know that here I am waiting for your return to my life, my Santiago, my Nicolás or my Gala.I accept you in a whole. Give me a sign that you are okay and ease my pain, my great love. I die a little bit every day. It's already been four long years of absence that have torn my soul, ”he said.
