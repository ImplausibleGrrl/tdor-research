Lana
12 Oct 2021 [burial date]
Aracaju
Sergipe
Brazil
not reported (suicide?)


A transvestite from Aracaju named Lana died and was buried as a man by the family: in a suit, tie and with a pencil-drawn mustache. The councilor of Linda Brasil (Psol), who is a trans woman, said that what happened was absurd and an act of transphobia against the woman who, according to her, was buried on Tuesday (12). 
 
“I was outraged when I heard about this case that happened today in Aracaju. Enough of romanticizing family relationships that disrespect and neglect our lives, identities and existences. It is because of such cases that there are so many crimes against children, adolescents, women and LGBTQIA+ people in general. This is not only violence and disrespect against the transvestite herself, but against all transgender people. Transphobia is a crime!”, wrote the parliamentarian.

> In the heat of indignation I ended up not detailing (and even out of respect for the victim), but this case was here in Aracaju. We need to put a stop to this romanticization of family relationships that disrespect and neglect our lives, identities and existences.

> I even filed a bill to respect the social name in line with gender identity on tombstones, tombstones and other related documents, but unfortunately it was not understood as within the parameters of constitutionality.
