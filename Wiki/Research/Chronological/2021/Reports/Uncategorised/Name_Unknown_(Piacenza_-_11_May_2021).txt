The body of a Brazilian transsexual found in a side driveway near the highway entrance. On the spot the forensic police and the mobile team

A body was found this morning, Tuesday 11 May, in Le Mose, in a pedestrian alley near Piacenza Expo. It was a Brazilian transsexual, apparently found lifeless by a passer-by who raised the alarm. The 118 health workers, after carrying out the resuscitation maneuvers, ascertained the death and the mobile team and the scientific police intervened on the spot for investigations, together with the steering wheels. The causes of death have yet to be clarified, although it would seem that the body does not show signs of violence: it was lying on the ground and partially undressed. Pm Daniela Di Girolamo was also on site.
