> Murder or accident? A robbery that ended badly or an excess of psychotropic drugs and alcohol? These are some of the aspects being examined by the carabinieri who investigate the death of the transsexual  found dead with a wound to the forehead in via Conversanoin Casale Rosso, a small neighborhood between via Prenestina, viale Togliatti and Quarticciolo. A real thriller, starting with the identity of the victim. 24 hours after his death, the inhabitants of the neighborhood on the eastern outskirts of the capital spontaneously began to bring flowers to the site of the tragedy by word of mouth: "to give dignity to a person who no one here in Rome seems to care about ", they let you know from Colletivo Giovanile Casale Rosso, born in October 2020 to give voice to the problems of the area, which ended up in the center of the news many times for bloody events, as happened on the morning of Tuesday 22 June. 
> 
> Adrieli, this is the name by which the transsexual was known. Still not officially identified, investigators allegedly ascertained the identity of the victim, a Brazilian who arrived in Rome from a small town in the state of Paraiba, in the north-east of the South American country. Certainty about his identity that will come only through his fingerprints, with the results expected by the hour by the military.
> 
> Identification of the victim 
> While waiting to give a certain name to the victim, who had his relatives in Brazil, there remain many aspects on which the carabinieri of the Compagnia Roma Montesacro coordinated by Major Spinnato must shed light. First of all if Adrieli died as a consequence of a violent death or if she died due to a tragic fatality. The investigators, who maintain the utmost confidentiality on the investigations, in fact do not exclude any scenario with the Deputy Prosecutor Andrea Cusani, owner of the investigations, who awaits detailed information from the carabinieri to open the investigation file on the death of the transsexual.
> 
> Two aspects of Adrieli's death are tinged with mystery: her purse, inside which an empty bottle of benzodiazepines was found, a powerful psychotropic drug that mixed with alcohol causes devastating effects on those who take it, and a friend of hers, a transsexual. Brazilian known as Carolina. Alerted by a resident of the area who was going to take his car parked in via Conversano, when the Montesacro carabinieri arrived on the spot with the investigators of the VII Investigative Unit in via in Selci, they found, not far from the body without life of Adrieli, a friend of hers, also a transsexual. That she had fallen asleep on the road the night before the body was found.
> 
> Carolina's testimony 
> Visibly drunk and presumably under the influence of psychotropic drugs, the transsexual was in fact found by the police not far from the corpse of her friend. Woke up by the police, it was Carolina herself who gave the carabinieri the name by which Adrieli was known, reporting that her friend had had an argument with a client. A truthful reconstruction or a story dictated by the state of psychophysical alteration of the transsexual? This is the doubt that the investigators would have, who in any case collected the testimony of the victim's roommate, not leaving out any details at the moment. 
> 
> Another yellow concerns the content, or rather the non-content, found in the handbag found next to Adrieli's body lying on his stomach. In fact, in the same there was only the empty benzodiazepine bottle. Neither keys, nor documents but above all no mobile phone. An aspect that also opens the way to a possible robbery that ended in blood, but even on this element the investigators keep their mouths sewn together. 
> 
> The autopsy to clarify the causes of death
> After the body was transferred to the Verano morgue, the Judicial Authority ordered an autopsy on the transsexual's body. Autopsy examination whose results could give an important new impetus to investigations both to understand the causes of Adrieli's death and to ascertain whether she abused psychotropic drugs or not. According to an initial examination by the coroner on the body of the transsexual, there were no obvious signs of violence with the head injury that could have been caused following a fall. But there is a but: a long trail of blood found next to the body of the Brazilian town. It also remains to be ascertained whether the death of the transsexual took place where the body was found or whether it was eventually transported from another place.
> 
> Flowers in Casale Rosso
> While awaiting the resolution of the mystery, in via Conversano, the road that connects via Prenestina to via Manfredonia and via Trani, the residents of Casale Rosso have begun to bring flowers. " A spontaneous initiative - explains to Rome Today Giulio Mattone, of the Collettivo Giovanile Casale Rosso -. When we learned of the death of this poor person, we put a hand on our heart and wanted to show her and the city our closeness and our condolences. This neighborhood ends up on the pages of the newspapers only for these bloody episodes, which very often concern transsexuals. From what I recall, at least four transsexuals found dead between piazzale Pascali and via Collatina in the last two years " .
> 
>  " This area is not just transsexuals - concludes Giulio Mattone - but a community of about 700 inhabitants that over the years has fought and won numerous battles to restore dignity to this area. Now this poor girl has lost her life, but no one is he is indignant or has expressed condolences for his death. That is why we decided to fill the street with flowers, so that his death was not in vain ". 



> Body of a trans woman found in a canal on Prenestina: murder hypothesis
> Murder is not excluded among the hypotheses that led to the death of a transsexual woman, whose body was found this morning with a head wound in a water drainage channel along Via Prenestina at the height of via Conversano in Rome. They investigate the carabinieri.

Upon receipt of the report, the local carabinieri intervened on the spot. Unfortunately, the rescues were useless, unfortunately there was nothing for the woman to do except to note her death, ascertained by the 118 health workers who arrived by ambulance. The soldiers of the Investigative Unit of via in Selci also intervened on the spot, for scientific surveys and to reconstruct the dynamics of the incident.
> 
> The coroner and the magistrate on duty arrived on viale Palmiro Togliatti today for the first on-site checks. Those who investigated and carried out the first checks on the body found a wound on the forehead, which does not exclude any hypothesis, including murder. Post-mortem examinations will subsequently clarify the causes that led to the death. At the moment little information is known, the investigators are at work and it is not clear how the body got inside the canal, if anyone abandoned it and then left. Every hypothesis is currently being examined and the investigators do not exclude any leads, but at the same time do not let any further information leak out.
