> Danielle Bunten Berry (St. Louis, MO) was a transgender computer programmer and game designer. She spent much of her childhood caring for her younger siblings and playing board games together, experiences she later applied to the video games she designed. Berry predicted video games would become multiplayer at a time when game designers focused on single-player games. While working for Electronic Arts in the 1980s, she designed M.U.L.E., which became a classic video game. Berryâ€™s use of modems to create multiplayer gaming experiences opened the door for the multiplayer games common today. She also designed Seven Cities of Gold, and though it was not in her signature multiplayer style, it was a huge success because of its user-friendliness. Berry underwent gender-affirming surgery in the early 1990s, a few years before she died of lung cancer in 1998 at forty-nine. Just before her death, the International Game Developers Association awarded Berry a lifetime achievement award for her visionary contributions. The Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences added her to its Hall of Fame in 2007.
