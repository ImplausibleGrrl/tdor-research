Robert Eads
17 Jan 1999

17th January 1999: Robert Eads dies of ovarian cancer. More than two dozen doctors in Georgia refused to treat Eads - who was transgender - on the grounds that doing so would harm their practice. #OnThisDay #Queerstory

Robert Eads was 51 when he was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 1996. Despite him immediately seeking medical help, more than a dozen medical providers rejected his case, feeling that taking on a transgender man would damage the reputation of their practice. By the time Eads did find treatment in 1997, the disease had become quite advanced. Eads’ story originally came to the public eye in a 2001 GLAAD Media Award-nominated and Sundance Film Festival Grand Jury Prize-winning documentary called “Southern Comfort.”
The story follows Eads during a year of his life and sheds light on the fact that due to prejudice that still exists today, Eads’ circumstances are not unique. In fact, the National LGBT Cancer Network reports that ovarian cancer will affect 1 in 72 people born with ovaries. Though the 5-year survival rate is at 90 percent when caught early, 75 percent of diagnoses are made in the later stages of ovarian cancer.
The story made its way into the public eye again in 2017 when Dan Collins and Julianne Wick Davis composed a musical stage adaptation of the story dedicated to bringing it to a new audience. Now, from April 26 through May 12, Royal Oak’s Stagecrafters theatre will bring it to Metro Detroit. Directing the upcoming performance is Jay Kaplan, a 20-year community theater veteran and ACLU of Michigan LGBT Project lawyer who said that the story was one about which he feels “passionately.” Ahead of the show, Kaplan filled BTL in about the differences in the musical adaptation, taking care to do justice to Eads’ story and the musical’s overall “uplifting” message of “love and understanding triumphing.”
