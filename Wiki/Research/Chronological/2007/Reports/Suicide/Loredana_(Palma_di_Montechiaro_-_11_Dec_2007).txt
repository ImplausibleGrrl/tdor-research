> PALMA DI MONTECHIARO- At the registry office her name was Paolo, 16, male, born in Catania, but she felt like a woman, dressed as a woman, put on make-up and called herself Loredana. A few years ago she had suffered mistreatment from her father, she led an unruly life, slept during the day and lived at night. Her mother could not support her, with her father, after the violence suffered, she had no relations, the Juvenile Court of Catania had intervened. Seven days ago, Loredana hanged herself with her favorite scarf inside the little room of the "Alice Community", in Marina di Palma di Montechiaro (Agrigento) where she had been a guest for three months to be "recovered". And to "recover" her, the Juvenile Court of Catania had assigned her to a community where she was forced to live with 35 boys, all males, immigrants,

> She, Loredana, was the only "woman" of that community and they had assigned her there "because no one wanted her" says Linda Lumia, the social worker of the center who four days ago, together with other "guests "of" Alice "accompanied her to the cemetery of Assoro (Enna) where Loredana was buried. "There were her mother and brothers, but none of the Arch Gay, not even a flower" underlines Linda Lumia that she had to face an incredible situation.
> 
> But is it ever possible that a boy, in fact a woman, to be recovered is sent to a community made up only of non-EU males? The social worker of the "Alice" welcome center - a beautiful structure that rises a few hundred meters from the sea, with a swimming pool, a soccer field, excellent cuisine and three-star hotel rooms - spreads her arms and does not hide his powerlessness in the face of such a situation which ended in tragedy.
> 
> Inside the center Loredana, which "was on trial", would not have had any problems whatsoever, say the managers of the structure, but the operators still tried to "protect her". "It was the first time we hosted a" girl "in a center for males and we had set up for her - says Linda Lumia - a single room. She somehow had her own privacy, she used the women's bathroom for the operators of the center, she ate with us. She was also happy because she was anxiously awaiting the start of the professional hairdressing course, but the other day she decided to quit it ".
> 
> The Prosecutor of Agrigento has opened an investigation that allegedly ascertained the suicide but is still investigating to ascertain any responsibility of others. We also want to ascertain how and why a boy, in fact a woman, ended up in that center populated only by men and not in another more adequate structure. The news of Loredana's suicide had been spread by the deputy of the Communist Refoundation, Vladimir Luxuria: "Despite the commitment of the social workers - says the parliamentarian - the young woman was not in a specialized structure to deal with the problems of gender dysphoria, especially in a delicate phase like that of adolescence.
> 
> "But where was the Arci Gay when I asked to help me?" says social worker Linda Lumia. "It is clear that our structure was certainly not the most suitable to deal with such a delicate and complicated situation. But we were the only ones and did not throw Loredana out. Nobody wanted her, all the other centers who had been asked to host her said no. Loredana had "previous" she had been hosted in other centers from where she had fled and where perhaps she had created some problems. But we did our best, we also asked Arci Gay to give us a hand. In words they said they would do something, but they have never seen or heard of each other ".
> 
> The social worker who had established an excellent relationship with Loredana and with whom he confided does not hide the difficulties encountered in managing that center with 35 males and one woman. "We have done everything possible and if Loredana found herself ill she could leave at any time because in these centers everyone is free to enter and exit, she could do as many other non-EU minors who stay here or in other places for a couple of days and then they disappear. But she didn't do it, also because she had nowhere to go, because no one wanted her ".
> 
> Before hanging herself, Loredana had written two letters, one to her mother and another to a friend of hers with whom she had a close correspondence. In three days she would come face to face with her father in the trial. "I can't live like this anymore, I can't take it anymore and I decided to get it over with ...", she wrote before hanging herself from the window of her room near the wall where she had posted a large poster of Marilyn Monroe.
