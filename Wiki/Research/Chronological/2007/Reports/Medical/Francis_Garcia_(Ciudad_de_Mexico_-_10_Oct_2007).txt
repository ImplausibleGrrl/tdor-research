Francis, why the most famous transvestite in Mexico 'revived' in networks
His show was a benchmark in Mexican shows.

In the midst of the era of openness to diversity and in the midst of the controversy over inclusive language that suits non-binary people, Francis 'revived' on social networks thanks to one of his presentations.

And how can we forget Francis, the most famous transvestite in Mexico, the last star of our country who was considered the queen of the night at the Blanquita Theater, where she presented her show for 17 years. Just one of his unrepeatable shows appeared on TikTok, perhaps presenting him with new generations and provoking the memory of those who knew him.

In recent days a fragment of her show went viral, in which she took a moment to talk about how people questioned her about her gender identity. So he said, with a touch of humor:

"-Francis, how do you want me to treat you? Him or her? ... 
-What are you seeing?
-She, but I know you are him
-Yes, asshole, if I don't tell you, you don't realize ... Right? 
And ultimately, who are you going to interview? The human being, not because of how he combs his hair, how he dresses, or who he sleeps with ... Right? it's good that they fuck ... but that their mother ... respect her. " 

His words resonate with the current discussion about inclusive language and the visibility of diversity collectives such as non-binary people, transgender and transsexuals, who sadly continue to battle against discrimination. But in the case of Francis, we are talking about a transvestite , that is, a person with his defined gender identity, who only dresses as the opposite gender, in this case, for his shows.

Francis never hid that he lived in "a duality" from his childhood. In an interview with René Franco, he explained: " I consider Francis a character created by Francisco. Francisco is the one who controls Francis. Francisco has taken control of Francis, never to have operations, implants, changes, for all that, Francisco He has had to fight a lot because the mirror is an enemy, you let yourself be carried away by the image and you can attack your body, and I definitely don't want Francis to be a woman. " 

He denied using hormones or having surgery to be transgender, because "inside is Francisco, he is the one who keeps the accounts, manages . It is difficult to understand, but it is a duality that I have assumed all my life, I feel comfortable and I have fun. " 

Francisco García Escalante died on October 10, 2007 from a pulmonary thrombosis in a hospital in Mexico City. With almost 30 years of experience, he stepped on various stages in Mexico and the United States, where the public surrendered to the genius of his show, which included imitations and parodies of celebrities.
