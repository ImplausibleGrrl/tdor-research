27-year-old Clara Johnson's body was discovered by a motorist around 2 am on 6 July, 1957, laying in the street about 50 feet east of Wadsworth Ave on 51st Street. The police initially thought they had been the victim of a traffic accident, but examination quicky showed she had been stabbed in the neck and bled to death. Her clothes were saturated in blood. No suspects were reported, although she had been seen in the company of another woman earlier that night. 

Her acquaintances reported that she had been a very quiet woman with a very nice personality.
