 Laura Belle Johnson, of Gilmer, Tex.

=== Known  to Police ===

 Johnson was known to the police as a sex psychopath and was so registered with the police and with the FBI. He had been arrested on many occasions for vagrancy.

His landlady, Mrs. Shirley Holland, 986 E. 51st street, identified Johnson. She later told the Eagle that "she" had moved into the rear house in March, but had been arrested about two weeks later and was released June 18.  While still in prison, Clara had written Mrs. Holland, asking her to hold the room and not to dispose of her belongings.

Mrs. Holland said after Clara was arrested, she had gone into the room and there she found both men's and women's clothes.

=== Very Masculine ===

"She was very masculine," commented Mrs. Holland. "She tried to give me the impression she was a missionary. She said she was a member of the Second Baptist Church, and she was recommended to me as a Christian person. She told me she did day work, but sometimes when she said she was going to Hollywod I would see her later the same day in the neighborhood."

After the murder, Mrs. Holland checked with members of the Second Baptist Church and learned that "Clara" had not been a member, but that she had attended some services there. She was also told that Clara had made advances to some of the women at the church.

=== Nice Personality ===

Mrs. Dorothy Douglas, 2104 E. 101st street; who operates a cafe at 5301 S. Central avenue, was also questioned by police. She informed the Eagle that Clara was a regular customer and had been coming around for six or seven months. She had been there the night of the killing, and had left about 2 a.m.

Clara, said Mrs. Douglas, had confided to her that she had been wearing womens clothes for about 14 years. She (everybody called Johnson "she") was very quiet. She never bothered anybody and had a very nice personality. She got along with everybody. She wasn't a heavy drinker—maybe one bottle of beer all evening. The body was discovered by a motorist, Lois Thadeus Bertrand, 1308 E. 45th street, who notified police. 

Motive for the murder is unknown; so also is the identity of the killer.
