> The memory of a prospective councillor who died suddenly last year will be kept alive thanks to her fellow Labour Party members.
> 
> Wales will take a leap forward in its services for gender identity after friends of Lily Summers pushed through a motion in her honour at last weekend’s Welsh Labour conference.
> 
> It is thought that Miss Summers would have been Swansea’s first transgender councillor if she had been elected for the Uplands ward in this May’s local elections.
> 
> The 23-year-old’s death from ill-health in December last year shocked Swansea people and brought tributes from across the party divide, with many hailing her passion for social change.
> 
> At the Llandudno conference Welsh Labour Students brought “The Lily Motion”, which called for improved gender identity services and health care for transgender people in Wales.
> 
> The successful motion also brought into life the Lily Summers Memorial Award for LGBTQ activism and established The Lily Lecture, an annual fundraising event to commemorate the Swansea University student.
> 
> LGBTQ is the shorthand for the community of people identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer.
> 
> Josh James, chair of Welsh Labour Students, told the conference that it should be his “friend” Miss Summers “giving this motion”.
> 
> He said: “Lily was a passionate Labour member, a fierce advocate of social justice and LGBTQ rights. More recently Lily was our women’s officer, but more than that a close friend who was taken from us far, far too early at the age of just 23.
> 
> “Current health care provision for trans people in Wales just isn’t good enough and we need to recognise that. At the moment we fail trans people very day.”
> 
> Last year Jenny-Anne Bishop, of Unique Transgender Network, said Wales was “about five to 10 years behind England and Scotland” when it came to treating transgender people.
> 
> There are currently no gender identity clinics in Wales, making it the only part of the UK not to have one.
> 
> The new motion commits Welsh Labour to increasing investment for transgender healthcare.
> 
> Mary Sherwood was picked by the Labour party to fight for the Uplands seat in Miss Summer’s place.
> 
> Mrs Sherwood, who was at the conference representing the Uplands Labour team, said: “Uplands Labour branch is very grateful to Welsh Labour Students for taking this action in memory of the wonderful young woman we were so proud to have selected as a council candidate for our ward.”
