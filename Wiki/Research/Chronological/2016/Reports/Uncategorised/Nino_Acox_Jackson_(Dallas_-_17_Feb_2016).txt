Members of the Living Faith Covenant Church, an LGBT-affirming congregation in Dallas, gathered on February 22 to celebrate the life of Nino Acox Jackson, a 26-year-old black transgender man.

The Rowlett Police Department found Jackson deceased on February 16 in Lake Ray Hubbard, according to the Dallas Voice. Jackson had been missing since January 19. 

Texas Department of Public Safety officials found Jackson’s cream Pontiac Firebird abandoned on the southbound side of President George Bush Turnpike at 9:30 a.m. on January 20, reports the Dallas Voice. Police issued a “critical missing” bulletin the same day.

Although officials reportedly searched the waters of Lake Ray Hubbard, their initial search was fruitless, and Jackson’s body was not discovered until nearly a month later. While the exact circumstances of his death are unknown, a spokesperson for the Rowlett police told The Voice that Jackson may have committed suicide. 

“With sorrow, we confirm the passing of our brother, Nino Acox Jackson," wrote Bishop Alex D. Byrd in a February 18 post on the Facebook page of the Living Faith Covenant Church, where Byrd serves as a co-pastor. 

“Our deepest condolences to his family, friends & the entire transgender community. Rest in power Nino Acox Jackson,” said Equality Texas, an LGBT advocacy organization, in a February 19 tweet.

In posts and messages on Facebook (many of which have since been marked private), friends praised Jackson for his advocacy for trans equality, his supportive demeanor, and his handiness in working on cars.

Jackson’s Facebook page features colorful pictures that highlight his passion for fast cars and Japanese anime. As his Facebook account makes clear, Jackson’s friends and acquaintances include trans advocates from across the country.
