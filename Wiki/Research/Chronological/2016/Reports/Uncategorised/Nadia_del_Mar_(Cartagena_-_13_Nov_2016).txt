They deplore the death of a trans woman in Cartagena
Just as this capital was preparing for the eighth 'March for Independence and Diversities', Caribe Affirmativo confirmed that near the Román Bridge, near the Getsemaní neighborhood, the Police found the body of a trans woman floating in the bay. 

The victim was identified as Jesús Flores Jiménez, 24, but her identity name was Nadia del Mar, a sex worker. She had multiple contusions, apparently from a fall in which she collided with stones. 

Caribe Affirmativo reported that four LGBTI people have been murdered this year in Cartagena: three trans women and one gay man. Last year there were no victims. 

"The days before the marches and mobilizations are the most dangerous, because that is when there are most cases of violence, especially trans women," said Wilson Castañeda, director of the group.
