Transsexual found dead at Lagaccio "She was depressed about her father's death"

DECEMBER 14TH 2016
Genoa - The hypothesis of the illness for the death of Jorge Arturo Romero Gurimendi, the 34-year-old Ecuadorian transsexual, known as Carolina, found dead last night in her apartment , in Via del Cipresso al Lagaccio . At first the investigators had thought of a murder , but as the hours went by this trail faded. Next to the body in a state of decomposition some syringes have been found that suggest a possible drug overdose . The coroner, from a first reconnaissance on the corpse, showed no injuries.

The hypothesis of robbery also excluded

The hypothesis of a degenerate robbery is also excluded: the wallet with the victim's money was found on a bedside table. But the hypothesis of the crime of passion is not entirely excluded . Jorge Arturo, a prostitute, may have been the victim of a client or a lover who may have suffocated or strangled him. But this can only be said by the autopsy scheduled for tomorrow.

The former boyfriend will be heard. She had reported him for mistreatment
But what emerges from the testimonies of some acquaintances of the woman is a turbulent past. A report, in particular, has attracted the attention of investigators. Carolina reported her ex-boyfriend , a 33-year-old Genoese, for ill-treatment . The ex-boyfriend had also been tried for that affair, he had apologized during the hearings and had promised not to come closer to Carolina. The 35-year-old today is trying to detox in a community in Biella. "As soon as I heard the news - the former boyfriend in tears explained - I immediately contacted the Genoese police. I have lived in Biella for two years, I explained everything to the investigators ». "I was very fond of Carolina- he continued crying - I can't explain what could have happened but I also want clarity to be made. We have had problems in the past, it is true, but she remains one of the most important people in my life ». It is not excluded, however, that the investigators want to hear it again in the next few hours.

The pain of friends and relatives

Sorrowful friends and relatives of Carolina. "She was a wonderful person, we can't believe she's gone." Pamela Marin is the wife of Jorge Arturo Romero Gurimendi's cousin . The woman ran into Via del Cipresso as soon as she learned of the finding of the corpse. As he looks at the flashing lights of the police cars, he shakes his head, distraught: " It is not true that he prostitutes himself. She had a job , as a caregiver and lived here at Lagaccio, in an apartment owned. " This is the house where firefighters found the body lifeless ( photo ). "I know that lately it was not doing very well economically: the mortgage was paid by the sister, who lives in the United States".

It was precisely her sister who heard her "three or four times a day by telephone, to become suspicious of her silence and to sound the alarm:" She could not hear her and so she called a neighbor to go and see for herself what had happened - says Pamela Marin - It's terrible, we can't understand what happened ".

Jorge Arturo Romero Gurimendi, for some time, had fallen into depression: " Before the summer his father died, at 52, in Ecuador . Mourning had profoundly marked him, so much so that he had begun to take drops to reduce his anxiety. At that time he returned to his country and stayed there for a while ».

The sister had become his only point of reference: "He confided in her whenever he could. He was a very private person, but he didn't hurt anyone. " A difficult period: " He dreamed of leaving Italy and returning to Ecuador. He often said it, even though his life was now here in Genoa. I don't know what happened in that apartment. " Pamela Marin ran here in the company of a friend, Mirna: "There are rumors about Jorge, but they are all unfounded. He was just a decent person, very attached to his family
