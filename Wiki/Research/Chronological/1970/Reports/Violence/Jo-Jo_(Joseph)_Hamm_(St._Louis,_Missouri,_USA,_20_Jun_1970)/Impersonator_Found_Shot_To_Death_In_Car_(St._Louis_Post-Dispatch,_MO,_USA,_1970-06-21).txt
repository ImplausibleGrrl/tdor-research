===== Impersonator Found Shot To Death In Car =====

Joseph (Jo-Jo) Hamm, a female impersonator, was found shot to death at 7:30 a.m. yesterday in an automobile in the 1800 block of Piggott Avenue, East St. Louis.

He was 30 years old and lived at 618 North Sixth Street, East St. Louis.

Hamm was wearing women's clothing when he was shot three times and left in the car. A woman walking past saw the body slumped across the seat and went to the nearby home of a security guard. He returned to the car with her and then telephoned police. 

Deputy Coroner John Kassly said the victim apparently had been dead for several hours.
