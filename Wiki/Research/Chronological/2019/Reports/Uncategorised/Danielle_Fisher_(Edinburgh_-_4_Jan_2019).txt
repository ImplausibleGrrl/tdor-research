TW - Grave stones and transphobia 
This broke my heart, This absolutely ruined me. 
If ever there was a reason to have pride every year, it’s this. Some woman’s last rest fucked with by transphobic family. The fact friends had to cover it up and fix it makes me so angry, that never should’ve been necessary!
I didn’t know the woman, I was looking for someone else, but I saw the flag and knew what had happened. 
Rest in peace Danielle
