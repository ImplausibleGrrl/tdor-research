> The Trans Doe Task Force (TDTF) has partnered with the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences (HCIFS) to identify the remains of an individual of uncertain race who was recovered from Brays Bayou in Houston, Texas on August 28, 2019 (NamUs #UP60036). The original analysis of the remains resulted in the decedent being classified as female, but subsequent DNA analysis revealed an XY karyotype, indicating they may possibly have been a Transgender woman. TDTF’s in-house and Trans-led team of LGBTQ+ and informed ally genealogists will work to identify this individual once the laboratory process is completed. The DNA extraction, sequencing, and bioinformatics will be done by the Hubbard Center for Genomics at the University of New Hampshire.  We will provide updates on the process as we are able. This case is being funded in entirety by the Trans Doe Task Force.

> Trans Doe Task Force co-founder Anthony Redgrave has created new forensic art based on the skeletal features observed on x-ray images and some soft tissue physical characteristics provided by HCIFS.  Please note that this is an approximation of what the individual may have looked like in life and not be understood as an exact representation.  This person was recovered wearing a women’s size 18/20 green short sleeved t-shirt with flower design, and dark colored cargo shorts.  They had short straight to wavy brown or black hair and a small diagonal scar above their left eyebrow.  Two versions of the art are provided; the individual is estimated to be between 50 to 70 years in age, but given the possibility of variation in age estimation we are providing a younger-appearing and older-appearing image.  We do not know how they presented in life; therefore, if these images somewhat resemble someone you know of any gender who has been missing, do not hesitate to reach out to Detective Barton Nabors at the Houston Police Department at (713) 884-3131.
