NOT ON TDOR LIST

On Thursday the 1st August, 2019 around Kayunga, a transgender woman identified as Fahad Ssemugooma Kawere was attached by a mob of motorcyclists and beaten leading to her death. The fact stipulated to by witnesses, including motorcyclists and the deceased's parents, indicates that she was picked from ther neighbouring motorcycle stage with the intention to be taken to a different destination to do some business transactions, after transacting her business, she got another motorcycle to take her back to her parent's home since she was staying with her parents. Unfortunately, the deceased never reached home because the first cyclist way laid with other motorcyclist who beat her into unconsciousness nearby the close trading center.

It was alleged that the murder was as a result of the deceased's gender identity. Given the cirmustances surrounding the murder, particularly the fact that the deaceased in a mob attack in Kayunga, which is less than an hour from both Kayunga and Wakiso, which are home to at least 3 LGBT organizations, 2 of which run LGBT shelters, ie Happy Family Youth Uganda (the deceased was a fully subscribed member) and Kuchu Shinners Uganda, the murder caused the panic within the LGBT community and raised serious issues of the security of the LGBT community members. It therefore became necessary to investigate the murder and confirm the facts surrounding and leading up to the fatal attack. With partners who helped in the entire investigation, reports were made but justice for our own has never been sought due to her gender identity.


One year after the gruesome murder of Fahad Semugooma Kawere a transgender woman, the case has fallen silent. Her family and friends are hungry for justice and while it currently seems like a far off cry, there’s light at the end of the tunnel as Human Rights Awareness and Promotion Forum (HRAPF) has released a detailed report of what transpired, the limitations of the case as well as what can be done going forward.

The 19-year-old was murdered by a mob of boda boda riders and all findings currently indicate that this ghastly crime was because Fahad identified as a transgender woman.


On Thursday the 1st of August, 2019 around Naluvule-Gombe, a transgender woman by the names of Fahad Ssemugooma Kawere (deceased) was attacked by a mob of boda boda riders and beaten, leading to her death. The facts as stipulated to by several witnesses, including boda boda riders and Fahad’s parents, indicate that she was picked from “Ovacado stage” by a motorcyclist (boda boda rider) with the intention of being taken to Mpuga village. After transacting her business in Mpuga, she got another motorcycle to take her back to Kayunga, where she was staying with her parents at the time. Unfortunately, the deceased never reached her destination because the first cyclist waylaid her with other boda boda riders, who beat her into unconsciousness near Naluvule trading centre.

#TODAY: Happy Family Youth Uganda launches the Fahad Rainbow Memorial House, a shelter for homeless LGBT individuals in Uganda supported by Rainbow Foundation- Sweden and Kwetu Foundation.

This home is named in rememberance and honor of Fahad Ssemugoma alias Legit' Ferhd Kawere, a former member of Happy Family Youth Uganda and #transgender who was murdered by a mob of bodaboda cyclists on August 2nd this year in Gombe. It is disheartening that to date, the perpetrators of this brutal crime have never been charged or brought to book.

May Fahad's soul continue to rest in peace.
