> Clara, a happy little girl, has everything to lead a happy existence. It is without counting on the fate which persists. A drama at the entrance to college digs a first flaw. When at puberty the curves arrive, she takes her body in aversion and gradually becomes Maxence. Between harassment and the search for identity, she, he, she will leave her last strength in this fight. The author, her mother, fights so that children and adolescents understand that they are not alone, that there is always a parent, a teacher, an adult to listen to them, that contrary to what they think, there is a solution other than death to their despair. This story recounts Maxence's battle against the gender assigned at birth, but also gives life to those close to him, opens up on resilience, rebirth after the suicide of a child, a friend. If he can save just one of these teenagers, Maxence might not have died for nothing.
