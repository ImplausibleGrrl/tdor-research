Former professional League of Legends support Maria "Remilia" Creveling died on Friday, according to a tweet posted Saturday by close friend and roommate, esports journalist Richard Lewis. She was 24.

"It is with great sadness that I inform you that my best friend Maria Creveling passed away peacefully in her sleep yesterday," Lewis, who lived with Remilia in Las Vegas, said in a tweet. "Her absence will leave a void that can never be filled.

"She would not have wanted any lengthy statements or grand eulogies. Despite having fans all over the world she was never one who craved the spotlight. My only request is that anyone wanting to pay tribute reach out to ensure that it is done in a manner that respects her wishes."

Remilia made history in late 2015 after she became the first woman to qualify and then compete in the League of Legends Championship Series with Renegades.

Remilia, who was a transgender woman, only competed with Renegades in that league for close to a month before she left the team, citing pressure and harassment she received related to her appearance. Renegades were banned from the league that May with league operator Riot Games alleging poor working conditions and collusion with another competitive team, Team Dragon Knights.

After her time on Renegades, Remilia competed with Latin American team Kaos Latin Gamers, served as a backup for LCS team FlyQuest and more recently competed in the American amateur scene with Sector 7. She also streamed on Twitch and competed in the Twitch Rivals Team Draft event in November.

Pressure and harassment in relation to your appearance
Creveling , who was a transgender woman, competed with the "Renegades" of Detroit in the 'LCS' US for just over a month. Then he left the team, referring to the pressure and harassment he received due to his gender identity.

That led her to disappear from social networks for some time. But the gamer  got up from that stumble and got a solid fan base, being much loved by many. Hence, his sudden death was like a jug of cold water for fans of 'LOL' .

In recent times, 'Remilia' faced a hard operation due to the constant pain he suffered in his body. Lewis had helped the player financially, in addition to accompanying her at all times. Although no details have been offered about his death, some media say it is related to this last step in the operating room.


The first professional League of Legends player, Maria Creveling, has died at 24 . In 2015, she was the first woman to enter the League of Legends Championship Series with the American Renegades team. A year later, he retired because of the transphobia, harassment and daily insults he received.

It is with great sadness that I inform you that my best friend Maria Creveling passed away peacefully in her sleep yesterday. Her absence will leave a void that can never be filled.


María Creveling, also known by her username “ Remilia, ” apart from a professional League of Legends player - one of the world's most successful free video games - broadcast her games on the Twitch online live platform. During his professional life he faced numerous transphobic attacks .

The blog specialized in "Trans information and experiences" GenderLens , has suggested that the death of Maria Creveling could have been a suicide caused by harassment and daily insults. "It would be more accurate to say that they have killed her: because she has been constantly harassed, she had to leave the competition, lost her Twitch account and, today, transphobia has killed her ."


His friend says he jokingly asked her to kill her: "Every day during the break she went up the stairs, went to the room where I was, sat on the couch, put a pillow on her face, tried not to cry and she told me that she had a miserable life, that she didn't know what to do. The only thing that made her happy was to play in the LCS. She wanted to win, but she couldn't with all these things. "

"I always made a joke in which I wondered if I could kill her. If I could grab the pillow and kill her. It was horrible… It broke my heart to see someone like that. There I realized that she had self-injured. I had many cuts on my arms. Everyone knew this was happening, but nobody did anything. Everyone's attitude in the house was 'Maria is unstable and we need her to play', so they made nothing happen. "

Lewis told more details about the ordeal that followed the operation: "He had a very large surgery. He had to wear a chest support to help with the healing. He was in constant pain. And he played over it. That's why I was pissed off when the people criticized her in the comments They said she wasn't good enough She was in constant agony for the surgery And if not, she was doped by pain relievers That was her condition that season and she never used it as a excuse. He always tried to contribute to the team. "

One of Remilia's last messages said: "This doesn't look like Christmas, this just looks like a depression . " They investigate if his death has to do with a last operation that was complicated or if Maria Craveling ended up committing suicide.
