 trans boy committed suicide, in the middle of his transition process
The incident occurred in the United Kingdom and the mother issued a statement.

A British trans man committed suicide, after suffering episodes of depression, during his gender transition process. He was 25 years old and had just had surgery to remove breast tissue.

This is Max Cresham, who showed on social networks what his process was like. Last July, he was found hanged, after an argument with his partner, according to the British newspaper Daily Mail .

The authorities who knew him and dealt with him, in the clinic where his treatment was carried out, maintain that they had no record of presenting suicidal or depressive thoughts.

However, his mother made a statement, where he said that his transgender son had been diagnosed with depression and anxiety, before beginning his gender change process.

“He had started taking hormonal pills, which developed acne. This was so severe that it changed my mood and took medication to be treated, ”he said.
