The mother of a transgender woman found dead at her flat in Bristol has told an inquest that her daughter and other people with mental health issues had died because they are unable to access the talking therapy they needed.

A month before she apparently took her own life, Alexandra Greenway, 23, was escorted to a psychiatric hospital for her own safety by police after what they believed was a suicide attempt.

The consultant psychiatrist who spoke to Greenway at the hospital wrote to her GP recommending that she received talking therapy.

Greenway was relieved at the idea that she was finally going to get the treatment she felt she needed, but by the time she died on 11 May last year, no therapy had been arranged.

Her mother, Jacqueline Greenway, told Avon coroner’s court: “The fact is people keep dying, and they die because the treatment doesn’t materialise.”

She called on the area coroner, Peter Harrowing, to make sure that action was taken to “make sure this doesn’t happen to anyone else again.”

Greenway, a recruitment consultant, identified as a transgender woman. She had gender-affirming treatment, including a surgical operation in 2017.

She was distressed over issues including a desire for treatment to remove body hair. The court heard that she had previously been upset at not being able to get talking therapy and at the time of her death was down about her job.

The inquest was told that on 10 April 2019 – almost exactly a month before her death – police were called to try to help her when she apparently tried to take her own life after leaving work at lunchtime. She told an officer that she had voices in her head that “never go away”.

Officers tried to call their own mental health triage team, but nobody was on duty. They decided to detain her under section 136 of the Mental Health Act, but there was no bed for her in Bristol, and she had to be taken to a psychiatric hospital in Devizes, Wiltshire.

Dr Toby Sutcliffe, the consultant psychiatrist who examined Greenway in Devizes, said he spoke to her for an hour. She seemed calm and did not mention hearing voices.

He said she told him that she hoped being taken to hospital would mean she would get help she had not received in the past.

Sutcliffe said she told him she wanted to access care and wanted to get better.

She was discharged from hospital the same day and Sutcliffe wrote to her GP recommending that she received cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).

The inquest has been told that Greenway suffered heart and respiratory failure. Police treated her death as suspected suicide.

The hearing continues.


Alexandra Greenway was 23 years old when she died on 11 May 2019. She became unresponsive after excessive vomiting that night, having potentially ingested a toxic substance. Alexandra was a transgender woman, who experienced mental ill health and was under the care of Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust and her local GP. In the weeks before her death she reported increasing distress relating to a desire for the gender affirming treatment of hair removal.

Alexandra was from Bristol. She loved literature and enjoyed playing the guitar. Her family say that as a child, she had an inquisitive mind. She could read by the age of three and was regarded as a gifted child at school. She was interested in political controversy and human rights. She chose to study clinical psychology at university, because she was interested in what made people tick.

Alexandra identified as a transgender woman. She had previously accessed some gender affirming treatment including a surgery in 2017, but her family report she had very difficult experiences with this including poor treatment by NHS staff. Alexandra also had complex mental health needs. Trans people are at disproportionately high risk of mental ill health and suicide.

Stonewall report that almost half of trans people (46%) have thought about taking their own life in the past year. In the National LGBT Survey a picture was painted by trans respondents of hard-to-access services for gender transition and gender identity, a lack of knowledge among GPs about what services are available and how to access them, and the serious consequences of having to wait.

Healthwatch UK report that trans people’s experiences of long waits for gender affirming support and treatment, such as hair removal, affect their mental health. However, there is little official guidance available for GPs on how to treat trans people who look for support, despite their key role in supporting people to access services.

Just over a month before her death, on 10 April 2019 Alexandra was detained by police (under Section 136) after attempting to jump from a bridge. She was taken to the Bluebell Unit at Green Lane Hospital, who assessed that there was no imminent risk to her safety. Alexandra was discharged to the care of her GP and she was provided the number of a crisis line in case things got worse.

Her parents report they were not informed about this incident, and no care plan was recorded. No discharge letter was ever sent to her GP. Alexandra was awaiting referral to Bristol Well-Being Therapies. At the time of her death she was not receiving mental health treatment, with the exception of anti-depressants. In the days leading up to her death, Alexandra’s boyfriend, who she lived with, reported that she appeared increasingly unhappy and distressed. He woke to Alexandra vomiting, and called an ambulance, but she could not be saved.

Alexandra’s family hopes the inquest will consider:

Whether the mental health support leading up to Alexandra’s death was adequate,
The quality of risk assessment following Section 136 detention and discharge,
The monitoring of the medication she was prescribed.
The coroner did not grant the family’s request for a wider ranging inquest (under Article 2) which could have examined the broader circumstances surrounding Alexandra’s death, including her access to gender affirming treatment and the regard given to her higher risk of suicide as a transgender person. This also meant that the family were not able to access legal aid for representation, despite public services involved having publicly funded representation.
