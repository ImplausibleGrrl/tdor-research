Hello! We wanted to reach out to you about updating something on the website.

We noticed that a Trans Woman (Baby Alice) in the city (Washington, DC) we live in is listed on the list, but our fallen sister Angel Rose is not on the list. 

Angel and Baby Alice died the same week. The Washington Blade blames Angels community for her death. That same publication interviewed Baby Alice’s community and asked for their insight.

Because of that article, Angel Rose was blamed for her death, and her community was shamed for surviving. Her death was never brought to justice. Like many other Trans Women of Color, her death was dismissed as commonplace.  

This November, people all over the world are going to be the saying the names of the Trans People murdered around the world. Though Angel will be forgotten by others, she won’t be forgotten by us! We even changed our collective name to honor her because we wil continue to fight for her. 

We hope Angel can be added to the list so others around the world can know her story and what an amazing woman she was.Beating heartCherry blossomCherry blossomSparkles 





CN: Death of one of our community members

Nelwat Ishkamewe family and community,

It is with a heavy and grieving heart, we are sharing with you what we learned a couple of nights ago about our friend, fellow artist, and chosen family member Angel Rose. Angel has passed away.

A couple of hours after some of Angel’s chosen family had last seen her at the NJNP Collective in Washington, DC, a cis white man called PG County Police and told them a friend was unconscious and breathing strangely. When first responders arrived on the scene, Angel had already lost her life. The cis man gave no indication of who Angel was to the police and so they were unable to contact Angel’s chosen family.

After not hearing from Angel, the Two-Spirit & Trans BIPOC community in DC/MD/VA began our search for our missing sister. We were able to get a hold of Angel’s blood relatives and we met in person. Together with Angel’s biological mother, the community filed a missing person’s report in DC. An investigation was opened. Immediately after, the Two-Spirit community & Angel’s biological mother held an interview with the station Univision, and made pleads of support to find Angel. Within hours, a chosen family member received a phone call from PG County Police department. Unfortunately, they did not release any information to the chosen family, but asked for support finding the blood relatives.

Once PG got in contact with blood relatives, they were able to make a positive ID of Angel’s body in Baltimore, MD. Very little information was shared by the biological relatives to the chosen family, and so it was not until a local LGBT+ news site released a story on Angel’s passing, that many chosen family learned details about Angel’s death. Angel went unclaimed in a morgue for nearly a week before anyone she loved, knew where she was.

Her passing has been devastating to the community, not just because we have lost a beloved community member, but because her legacy is not being respected by blood relatives, the media, and the state. Angel Rose was a phenomenal woman, artist, advocate, and community member.

Angel was a leader in our collective. She had been serving as our Bilingual Community Outreach Director for the last couple of months of her life. Angel Rose was one of our Resident Make-Up Directors, one of our House Managers, a Costume Designer, an Understudy, an Actor, and so much more. She was an integral part of the Two-Spirit and Trans BIPOC Community.

Angel has touched the soul of so many in the Two-Spirit and Trans POC community of the DC Metro Area. She has changed so many of us for the better. It is because of this, that we are changing the name of our collective to the ANGEL ROSE ARTIST COLLECTIVE, in honor of all the labor she did to make our small but strong community more whole.

We love Angel so much; and Angel loved all of us unconditionally. Angel is with the Ancestors now. Angel Rose is now an Ancestor. And we honor you, Ancestor.
