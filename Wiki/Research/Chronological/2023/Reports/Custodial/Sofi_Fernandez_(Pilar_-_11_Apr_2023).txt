> We need justice for the aberrant event that ended the life of Sofi Fernández (39 years old), a trans person who on April 8 was arrested by police personnel from the 5th Police Station of Presidente Derqui, Pilar Party, because she was missing, contradicting himself with other police personnel who later informs that she was detained for alleged robbery. On 04/10, she stole a robbery without having contact with her family.
> 
> The same Monday afternoon, she is found dead in her cell, due to suffocation. Informing the family on 04/11 at dawn, the police station never communicated to be able to go and identify her body.
