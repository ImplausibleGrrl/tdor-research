> On Friday, the Transgender District will hold a candlelit vigil for Smith at the intersection of Turk and Taylor streets in the Tenderloin, a historically important gathering place for the trans community. 
> 
> Smith was also part of SFMOMA’s SECA Art Award Exhibition, which is currently on view. For I am Very Lucky, Very Lucky to be Trans, the Oakland-based visual artist Marcel Pardo Ariza photographed her along with Bay Area trans leaders in the manner of Catholic saints, to highlight a sense of joy and tenderness in that community. SFMOMA plans to hold a vigil of its own at an unspecified date.
> 
> Jupiter Peraza, a trans activist who worked with Smith at the district, remembered her as “magnificent, a brilliant leader.”
> 
> “I got to spend a lot of time with Ivory,” Peraza told The Standard. “We’re around the same age, so we definitely shared a lot of the same dreams and aspirations for the future. I was always amazed by how she interacted with her community with the utmost grace and respect and love. She led with kindness.”

> 
> Although local news has yet to cover the incident, the San Francisco Transgender District’s official Instagram account posted the news of Ivory Nicole Smith’s death last night. The Transgender District is the first legally recognized cultural district of its kind, according to the project’s website. Comprising several blocks in the Tenderloin, the district was founded by three Black trans women in 2017, and aims to create a “safe, welcoming and empowering neighborhood led by trans people.” 
> 
> “While we are working with authorities and close friends and family to gain more information — we want to share some of our favorite moments with an incredible angel,” the post reads, adding that there will be more information on her vigil and celebration of life soon. 
> 
> Yves Mathieu East, a model, queer activist, and singer, posted a tribute to Smith on his page last night, calling her his “gorgeous homegirl” and “a proud, beautiful, badass, strong, soft, femme queen, angelic, black trans woman.”
> 
> East wrote that Smith worked with the Transgender District, and was “committed to making sure the girls received fairness and equality.”
> 
> East and Smith met at a fundraiser for the Transgender District, which he said was “the start of such a beautiful siblingship with one another.” 
> 
> Aria Sa’id, the president and chief strategist of the Transgender District, posted her own tribute to Smith on Instagram last night. She wrote that she had “never been more devastated, more heartbroken.” 
> 
> “i - don’t know what to say,” she wrote. “i’m still shock. i love you @ivory_nicole_ . an angel. rest in power and love. Bbygirl.”
> 
> Her post features pictures of Smith looking joyful with a bust of Marsha P. Johnson, at a baseball game, raising her arms above her head on a stage, and more. The last image is the same picture that the Transgender District shared — a photo of Smith with a quote reading, “What I’m most passionate about is my future — and the way I treat my peers — and how I leave my mark on this beautiful planet.” 
> 
> Although details about Smith’s death are emerging, if foul play was involved, hers would be the fourth known violent death of a trans American thus far in 2023. Jasmine “Star” Mack was the first trans person whose death was reported this year, followed by KC Johnson and Tortuguita. 
> 
> Them has reached out to the Transgender District for more information on the circumstances of Smith’s life and death, and will provide further updates as we receive it.
