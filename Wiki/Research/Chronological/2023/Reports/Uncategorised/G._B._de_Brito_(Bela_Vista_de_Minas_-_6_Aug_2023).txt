> Fabricianense is the victim of a fatal hit-and-run on the BR-381, in the municipality of Bela Vista de Minas, early this Sunday (6). On call, the police found that the victim was a transvestite, found dead on the floor. The body was taken to the Legal Medical Institute (IML) of João Monlevade.
> 
> The victim, identified as Glauco Bastos de Brito, 37 years old, born in Coronel Fabriciano, according to Diario do Aço's report. The body was lying face up, with several abrasions, possibly resulting from a run over. The body also had a mouth bleed from the fall.
> 
> Contact was made with two witnesses who were at the scene when the car arrived and who had contact with the victim minutes earlier. Such witnesses reported that the transvestite was on a date and approached the driver of a truck. The man refused the service. At this moment, another truck arrived and Glauco went to this other vehicle.
> 
> The witness claims that he did not see the exact moment of the accident, as he was inside his vehicle watching videos and that five minutes later he saw a woman screaming and a person lying on the ground.
> 
> The witness believes that the second truck approached hit Glauco and that, in the fall, the victim hit his head, which led to his death.
> 
> The location of the fact has security cameras nearby, but due to the poor quality of the images and a tree located in front of the equipment, it was not possible to clarify how the accident occurred.
> 
> The body will be veiled this Monday (7), from 8 am, in the church "Gideões da Last Hour" in the Mangueiras neighborhood in Coronel Fabriciano.
