> I don't know the details of what happened, but a school friend of mine passed away. We weren't close until after highschool when we both came out as trans, and bonded in our shared identity. He struggled with abuse and rejection from his family, and He became addicted to drugs as a coping mechanism. I want to make sure he is remembered. Rest in pride Khayne Schirmer.

> I feel like it's the sort of question I'm not aloud to ask and probably wouldn't get a straight answer regardless.
