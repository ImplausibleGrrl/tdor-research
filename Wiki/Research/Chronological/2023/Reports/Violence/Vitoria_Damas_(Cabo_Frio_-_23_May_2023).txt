stabbed
 



> A transvestite was found dead inside a closed shop for rent on Rua Sul, in the Ville Blanche neighborhood, in Cabo Frio, this Tuesday afternoon (23). The victim, identified as Vitória Damas, had been missing for two days, according to information provided by Rodolpho Campbell, director of Grupo Iguais, which works in defense of LGBTQI+ rights.
> 
> Civil Police were called immediately and arrived at the scene to carry out the necessary procedures. Vitória's body was taken to the Instituto Médico Legal (IML), where it will undergo tests to determine the exact causes of death. The corpse was already in a state of decomposition, which indicates that the crime occurred some time ago.
> 
> The occurrence was registered at the 126th Police Station (126th DP), which will initiate investigations to clarify the details of what happened. So far, the authorities do not have information about the authorship and motivation of the crime, and no one has been arrested in connection with this case.

> IGUAIS GROUP ISSUES NOTE
> 
> “ It is with deep sadness and indignation that Grupo Iguais pronounces before the terrible event in the premises of a store close to the Alexis Novellino Bus Terminal, in Cabo Frio, where the body of a transvestite already in a state of putrefaction was found. The victim, at this first moment, was identified through the tattoos she had. This is Vitória Damas, who had been reported missing two days ago. We await confirmation of identity through the papilloscopic examination.
> 
> Unfortunately, considering the cruelty and brutality of the crime, we suspect that it was motivated by transphobia. Although it is not possible to determine at this time whether the cause of death was stabbing or shooting, it is clear that the victim suffered brutal assaults.
> 
> We would like to point out that the young woman's family does not reside in this region. Grupo Iguais is in direct contact with the family members, offering support and solidarity in such a difficult time. Likewise, we are ready to assist in the necessary procedures for Victoria's burial.
> 
> Faced with yet another tragedy involving a member of the LGBTI+ community, we demand an immediate, thorough and impartial investigation by the competent authorities. It is essential that those responsible for this heinous act of violence are identified and brought to justice. Violence, whether motivated by prejudice and discrimination or not, must be fought in our society.
> 
> Grupo Iguais reaffirms its unwavering commitment to the defense of human rights, the promotion of equality and the fight against any form of violence and discrimination. We will spare no efforts to support the victim's family and to ensure that this crime does not go unpunished.
> 
> In this moment of mourning and dismay, we call on all citizens and institutions to unite in the search for a fair, inclusive and respectful society, where everyone can live freely, without fear of becoming victims of violence or intolerance.
> 
> We express our deepest condolences to Vitória's family and friends, and we stand in solidarity with all those who fight daily for equality and human rights ."
