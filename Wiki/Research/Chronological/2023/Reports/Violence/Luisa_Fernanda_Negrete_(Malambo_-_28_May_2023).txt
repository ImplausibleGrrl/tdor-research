> In the early hours of this Sunday, May 28,  Luisa Fernanda Negrete, a 26-year-old trans woman  , was shot in the  Villa Esperanza neighborhood of the municipality of  Malambo . According to the preliminary information handled by the authorities, she was at 4B1A street with carrera 1R sur when she was approached by criminals.
> 
> It all happened at about 4:00 am. The story of her relatives of her revealed that the woman managed to scream; However,  after the last sound of her voice from her, the detonations were heard . When going out on the terrace, the relatives found her body de ella lying on the road. 
> 
> They immediately transferred her to the  Campbell Clinic in Malambo , where the doctors on duty managed to stabilize her and provide first aid. However, everything got complicated , because her injuries from her were so serious that they caused the subsequent death of Luisa, in the afternoon hours of the same day.
> 
> It should be noted that the preliminary report of the  Barranquilla Metropolitan Police  identified the victim as  Luis Felipe Mercado Méndez , since, apparently, they were unaware that Negrete belonged to the  LGBTIQ+ community.
> 
> Faced with this bloody event, the  Caribe Afirmativo collective  regretted and rejected what happened: “We deeply regret these events, hoping for a speedy clarification. We stand in solidarity with his family and friends in the face of this sad event. Faced with this unfortunate fact,  we demand an investigation in which the gender identity of Luisa Fernanda is recognized. Likewise, that Directive 004 of 2023 of the Office of the  Attorney General of the Nation  and the Guide to good practices for the investigation and prosecution of violence based on sexual orientation and/or gender identity (real or perceived) of the victim, prepared by the Prosecutor's Office and Caribe Afirmativo, with the support of USAID”.
> 
> Similarly, the collective announced that with the death of Luisa Fernanda, its  Human Rights Observatory  reported six cases of homicides and/or feminicides in the year 2023 in the  department of Atlántico , which is "worrying": “Compared to the previous year, it is worrying, since 2022 closed with the same number, six murder cases. This means that, in the second quarter of 2023, the same number and total number of victims of homicides and/or femicides is reported with respect to the previous year.”
> 
> For Caribe Afirmativo, this increase in violence against life and personal integrity towards the civilian population in the Atlantic, including LGBTIQ+ people, “ turns on alarms and demands the need  for a risk assessment by the authorities, which allows action to be taken effective for the guarantee of the  human rights of all the atlanticenses . It is worth noting that the Early Warning System of the  Ombudsman's Office , through AT 019-23, stated that the majority of the department of Atlántico is at a high risk level, recognizing the presence of illegal armed actors in the municipalities".
> 
> It should be remembered that a hearing was held in the department on the human rights situation of LGBTIQ+ people, which calls for action to guarantee the life, integrity and security of people with trans life experience, among them; a thematic hearing on these last cases and a Security Council on the different manifestations of violence reported in the department.
