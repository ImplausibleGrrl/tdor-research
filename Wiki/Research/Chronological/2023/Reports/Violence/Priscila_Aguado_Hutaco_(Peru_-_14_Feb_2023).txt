shot


Priscilla was killed by a gang who were extorting money from local sex workers.

Several days earlier [Ruby Ferrer](https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/reports/2023/02/14/ruby-ferrer_carabayllo-lima-peru_8afeda0d) had been killed in similar circumstances.

> Priscila Aguado and Rubí Ferrer, trans women, died at the hands of the prostitution and quota collection mafia.
> 
> Ruby, a native of Tarapoto, was kidnapped and taken from Cercado de Lima to Avenida Santo Domingo, Asociación Las Dalias, in the district of Carabayllo. “Just so you know, did you hear? You're leaving… from that… plaza”, the murderer is heard saying, who, with one hand records and with the other he shot him 15 times at point-blank range. 9 projectiles hit the victim's body.
> 
> On February 11, Priscila Aguado, a trans woman of approximately 30 years, was riddled with 4 shots. The woman died between the limits of Chorrillos and San Juan de Miraflores in Lima. It is presumed that she tried to ask for help during the early morning.
> 
> Although the media treat the issue as a murder due to transphobia or gender discrimination, there are no concrete facts to indicate that the homicide was carried out for reasons of hatred of her [gender identity] and orientation. Likewise, preliminary police investigations indicate that the murders are related to the issue of prostitution and quota trafficking.
> 
> This does not mean that these are two murders, which is why the LGBTIQ+ community held protests at the doors of the Alfonso Ugarte police station, demanding justice for the deceased.
> 
> "The deaths of Rubi Ferrer and Priscila Aguado cannot go unpunished, which is why we are demanding that the police attend to the complaint that was referred to Carabayllo and return to Lima, the place where they worked," said the spokesperson for the LGTBI collective.
> 
> Let us remember that during the early hours of February 10, the sex worker Gladys Acuña Espinoza (58), was riddled with bullets by two alleged hit men who shot her up to six times, killing her on the spot. The event occurred in the district of Puente Piedra.


> News sadly confirmed the murder of another colleague at the hands of the sycariat of foreign pimping.
> #AsesinaronAPriscilaAH
> 
> Yesterday I knew of two versions, that she had been killed by the airport and the other version was true and yes indeed she was also killed in another district. Priscilla A. H was kidnapped one day before her murder, the same thing happened to Ruby Ferrer who was kidnapped and both were killed Monday morning, Ruby Ferrer was killed first in Carabayllo. Both were in the same car in the video you can hear Priscilla's voice.. .. saying "enough is enough!" when Ruby was being put down by these miserable killers. Then they took Priscilla A. Even Chorillos wanted to try to escape but I can't and they ended their life. So they extinguished the lives of two trans women who fought to get ahead in this country that every time citizen insecurity is from bad to worse and organized crime is winning the battle to the forces of law and the state.
 



> A trans woman had an argument with another sex worker in the center of Lima, her pimps killed her and posted the video on networks. We have been denouncing pimping and quota collection for a long time but the police do not take care of us, they only take care of the interests of those who manage everything.
> 
> Priscila Aguado Atuco, another compañera has been found dead (Chorrillos border with SJM [San Juan de Miraflores, Lima]) in similar circumstances. She was still a minor.
