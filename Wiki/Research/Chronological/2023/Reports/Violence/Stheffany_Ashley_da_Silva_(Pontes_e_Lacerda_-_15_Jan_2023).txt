> The main suspect in the murder of Stheffany Ashley da Silva Neves, 27, over the weekend in Pontes e Lacerda, had his arrest converted from flagrante delicto to preventive this Tuesday (17). His accomplice, however, won the right to respond to the inquiry in freedom.
> 
> The decision was signed by the judge of the 3rd Criminal Court of Pontes e Lacerda, Leonardo de Araújo Costa Tumiati.
> 
> “I note [...] sufficient evidence of the existence of the crime, in addition to the authorship, [...] being, still, notably materialized by the statements of the police officers who carried out the arrest of the accused and his own qualified confession”, says an excerpt from the document.
> 
> Everaldo Pascoal Chapina admitted to killing Stheffany, but claimed in his statement that he had acted in self-defense.
> 
> The necropsy performed on Stheffany's body shows that she was murdered with a single shot fired to the head.
> 
> Stheffany was a trans woman and worked as a sex worker in the city. She would have been killed in a residence on Sunday night (15), and then had her body dumped in the Guaporé River.
> 
> As for Sergio Quirino dos Santos, according to the judge, “the precautionary estoppel is not justified [...], and the accused must respond in freedom, complying only with precautionary measures other than prison”, says an excerpt from the document.
> 
> According to the magistrate, the defense added to the case file a photograph that “corroborates in part with the version of the author of the homicide that he would have made a telephone call for Sergio to help him”.
> 
> There are, therefore, doubts as to Sergio's participation in the homicide.
> 
> Among the precautionary measures to be complied with is the “monthly appearance in court to inform and justify their activities”. Sergio is also banned from going to bars and must go to his house after 10 pm, and on days off.

> The autopsy performed on the body of Stheffany Ashley da Silva Neves, 27, who was murdered in Pontes e Lacerda on Sunday (15), showed that she died from a single shot fired in the head.
> 
> According to Politec (Official Technical Identification Expertise), the cause of death was found during the examination and informed in the Death Certificate.
> 
> Stheffany was a trans woman and worked as a sex worker in the city. She would have been killed in a residence and then had her body dumped in the Guaporé River.
> 
> She was located this Monday (16) and two people were arrested on suspicion of participating in the crime.
> 
> To hide the body, the killer enlisted the help of another man. The two suspects will respond for the crime of murder and concealment of a corpse.



> Pair arrested while trying to dispose of dead transsexual body in Pontes e Lacerda
>
> Two men suspected of involvement in the crime of homicide and concealment of a corpse were arrested by the Civil Police, on Sunday night (15), in action by the Pontes e Lacerda Police Station (442 km west of Cuiabá). The victim is a transvestite identified as Eyshila, 25 years old. Her body was removed from the water by the Fire Department on the morning of this Monday (16).
> 
> The steps began after the team received information that on the access road to the water collection station on the Guaporé River, on the BR-174, two men had just thrown a body into the river and were trying to flee the scene, but they were having problems in the vehicle. The car got stuck in the mud near the river.
> 
> Based on the information, civil police officers went to the scene and arrested the suspects in the act. Inside the vehicle, a 22 caliber gun was found, ammunition and a tarp with traces of blood. Expertise was carried out at the residence of one of the suspects, being compatible with the crime scene.
> 
> Investigations will be conducted by the Civil Police. The motive for the crime is still unknown and neither is the way in which the transvestite was killed.
