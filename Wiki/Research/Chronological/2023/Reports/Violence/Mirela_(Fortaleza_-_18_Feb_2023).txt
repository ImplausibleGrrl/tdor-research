A 27-year-old transvestite was killed with sticks, stones and blows resulting from a sharp object on Saturday night, the 18th, in the Floresta neighborhood, in Fortaleza. It was at least the third case of trans or transvestite people murdered this year in the state, according to a survey by O POVO .                                
                            
In this Saturday's case, the victim was identified only as Mirela. She would have had the house invaded by the author of the crime, who proceeded to carry out the aggressions. According to the Secretariat of Public Security and Social Defense of Ceará (SSPDS), Mirela was rescued by the Mobile Emergency Service (Samu), but she could not resist the injuries and died.
The SSPDS reported that the 8th Precinct of the Department of Homicide and Personal Protection (DHPP) is investigating the case. As of this writing, no suspects have been arrested.
