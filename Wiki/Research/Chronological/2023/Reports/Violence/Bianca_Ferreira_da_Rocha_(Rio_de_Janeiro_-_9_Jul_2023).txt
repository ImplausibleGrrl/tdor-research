> 
> A transsexual woman was found dead inside the house she lived in Morro do Juramento, in Vicente de Carvalho, in the North Zone of Rio, on the morning of last Sunday (9), relatives reported.
> 
> According to Joice Rocha, the victim's sister, a shot was fired in the victim's face and the body had marks of aggression. The house was set on fire along with the body.
> 
> The family identified the body at the Instituto Médico Legal as that of Wesley Felipe da Rocha, baptismal name of Bianca Ferreira da Rocha, who was a 32-year-old transsexual woman known as Bia.
> 
> On Saturday (8), she had gone out drinking and returned home at dawn. Neighbors noticed that her house was on fire around 6 am and tried to help, but the body was already on fire.
> 
> Due to the burns, the body still could not be released for burial. The Legal Medical Institute alleges that fingerprint recognition could not be done yet and a DNA test will have to be done.
> 
> When questioned, the Civil Police reported that "the visual recognition of the body has no legal value. Confirmation of identity needs to be done through necropapilloscopic examination, dental records or comparison of the genetic profile".
> 
> However, the corporation claims that this does not prevent the burial and that the death certificate can be rectified later.
> 
> However, the Civil Police did not say if any suspects were identified.
> 
> But, according to the family member, Bia had discovered she was HIV positive some time ago and the family suspects that her partner may have committed the crime out of anger.
> 
> The family does not know the suspect and claims that the relationship was recent.
