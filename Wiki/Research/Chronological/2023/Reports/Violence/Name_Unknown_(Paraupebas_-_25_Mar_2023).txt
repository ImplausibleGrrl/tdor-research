> At the Legal Medical Institute (IML) in Parauapebas, the body of a transvestite found dead on Rua São Luís, at the top of Bairro Nova Vitória, was still unidentified. Another transvestite, whose name was not disclosed, is the main suspect of having committed the crime. She was the last person the victim had contact with, early today (25).
> 
> She said that both would have spent the night drinking and that, already at dawn, the colleague would have asked her for her room key, to meet a man, whose name she does not know. Then she said that an injury to her own face had been caused by a nail in the wall and made other statements without the slightest sense. The stone and piece of wood will be examined in an attempt to find fingerprints that could point to the criminal.



> The Homicide Division of the 20th Urban Section of the Civil Police of Parauapebas is seeking information that may help identify a body found this Saturday morning (25), on Rua 18 , in Bairro Nova Vitória .
> 
> According to information obtained by the Pebinha de Açúcar Portal 's reporting team , the body of a transvestite was found by people with marks that would have been from sticks and stones on the head. Investigators are investigating whether the victim was killed or whether the body was just dumped in the place it was found.
