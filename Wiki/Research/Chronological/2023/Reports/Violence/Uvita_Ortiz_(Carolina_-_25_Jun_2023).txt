> 
> It was a 9-1-1 call that alerted to a person lying on the pavement. When the agents arrived, they found the body of the person with several bullet wounds.
> 
> Police commissioner Antonio López Figueroa reported in written statements that the case is being investigated as a transfemicide.
> 
> “The Criminal Investigation Corps (CIC) of the Police, attached to Carolina, is investigating all the angles surrounding the violent death of a trans woman, whose body presents bullet wounds. As established in the public policy of this Administration, the investigation is being conducted in accordance with the Protocol for the Investigation of Violent Deaths of Women and Transgender People by Reason of Gender," said López Figueroa.  
> 
> He added that the investigation has the support of the Gender Violence Division of the Police.  
> 
> “The agents are working on the investigation process that will lead to determining the true motive for death. As our duty dictates in all cases of violent deaths, we will not stop working until we clarify this death," said the Police Commissioner. 
> 
> The Puerto Rico Penal Code establishes that when the perpetrator has abandoned, exposed, or deposited the victim's body in a public place, and the victim is a person whose real or perceived gender identity or expression does not correspond to that assigned to the born, it constitutes a first degree murder and will be identified as Transfemicide. 
> 
> At the scene, between 7 to 8 bullet casings were identified.
> 
> The victim -who had a criminal record- was identified by one of his parents at the Institute of Forensic Sciences (ICF).
> 
> For his part, human rights activist Pedro Julio Serrano demanded that the authorities investigate the angle of hate in the murder.
> 
> "The protocol to follow, in these cases, requires that the possibility that this murder has been committed out of prejudice to the sexual orientation or gender identity of the victim be confirmed or ruled out. In the same way, the authorities have the obligation to investigate this murder without prejudice. We hope justice is done," Serrano said.
