> The murder of José Ranulfo da Costa, 52, a trans woman known by the social name "Cláudia", may be linked to two homicides that have occurred in Ipatinga in recent years. Cláudia was shot dead in a bar located on Rua Serra do Mar, in the Jardim Panorama neighborhood. In the attack carried out by two perpetrators on a motorcycle, a 58-year-old woman was also injured when she was hit by two stray bullets on Tuesday night (18) , as already announced by Diário do Aço.
> 
> The crime was committed around 7:15 pm, when two perpetrators arrived on a gray motorcycle, possibly a dark-colored Honda Fan. They stopped the vehicle on the other side of the street, when the passenger disembarked and went towards the victim Cláudia. The transvestite was talking to MS, 58 years old, on the sidewalk in front of the bar, where they were drinking.
> 
> The killer opened fire on the transvestite, but two shots hit the other victim who ran to the bar in an attempt to seek refuge. The author of the crime approached Cláudia, sitting in a chair, and fired one last shot in her head to “check” and make sure that she would die.

> The woman shot who survived was rescued and taken to Hospital Márcio Cunha. She was hit in the right side and chest, undergoing surgery to remove the projectiles. The Military Police found that the wound is in good condition and, at first, without risk of death.
> 
> Camera images confirm the dynamics of the crime
> PM teams obtained footage from nearby security cameras, which confirmed the dynamics of the crime through information passed on by witnesses. At the scene, in addition to the expertise of the Civil Police, a team from the Homicide Police Station of Ipatinga attended.
> 
> The forensic work found six perforations of entrances and exits in Cláudia's body, shots in the chest and head of her. The trans body was removed by Funerária Paraíso to the Instituto Médico Legal (IML) in Ipatinga.
> 
> Diário do Aço found out that Cláudia lived in the district of Cachoeira do Vale, in Timóteo. She constantly went to Italy and, according to a brother who spoke to the reporter at the scene of the crime, lately she would not have reported any situation of threat suffered. “I didn't have much contact, but I was with her over the weekend and she was calm”, he commented.
> 
> Cláudia gave escape to a murder suspect in 2019
> Despite this tranquility, the report found out from police sources that José Ranulfo, Cláudia, would have been involved in a homicide in 2019. The crime would have occurred on May 4 on Rua da Comunidade, in Morro do Sossego, in the Veneza II neighborhood, with Diogo de Melo Alves, 30 years old, known as Carioca, as the victim.
> 
> Cláudia would have helped one of the suspects in the murder, Douglas de Jesus, 29, to flee the scene of the crime, calling a taxi shortly after the murder and both went to the district of Revés do Belém, in Bom Jesus do Galho. At this location, the PM was able to locate and arrest the suspect.
> 
> However, Douglas was shot dead this year, late on the night of March 18, as reported by Diário do Aço. The victim was executed by two perpetrators on Rua Passos Dourados, in Morro do Sossego , next to a motorcycle.
> 
> Cláudia's murder on Tuesday night, in Jardim Panorama, as suspected by the police, would be consequences of these two situations. Two suspects of committing the murder of the transvestite were identified. Information that they would avenge Douglas's death, as they learned that the transvestite had arrived from Italy a few days ago.
> 
> One of these suspects, aged 28, allegedly stole a motorcycle from his father-in-law, a black Honda Fan, possibly the motorcycle used during Claudia's murder. Another suspect, aged 36, was located and sent to provide clarification to the Civil Police. He denies having any involvement in the crime, which is still being investigated by the police.
