> Fernielle Mary Mora, a beloved trans woman of color in the Bronx, was killed earlier this month after her safety was threatened. Not only did the NYPD drag their feet investigating, but they left the evidence in record heat for 2 weeks while the detective took a vacation!
> Fernielle Mary Mora's memorial fund is on GoFundMe. Her death impacts not only the trans community but also her immediate family. Hopefully, this is a wake-up call that trans people still face extreme violence in "progressive" cities. 




> Since the end of June STARR has been advocating on behalf of two vulnerable Trans women of color in NYC, one involving a tragedy. 
> Neither of which seem to be getting the attention and support from the wider queer community that they deserve.
> -In one instance a TWOC, Dasia Davis, was the victim of a brutal hate fueled assault stemming from an incident of rode rage (directed at her by a group of cis white women). The attack occurred on Pride Sunday, in the Village! We should all be outraged.
> -Another TWOC Fernielle Mary Mora was found deceased in her Bronx apartment on July 4th under suspicious circumstances. Despite tips pouring in surrounding obvious threats to her safety in the days leading up to it, the NYPD Dt who is assigned to the case went on a scheduled vacation shortly after her body was discovered. Ms Moraâ€™s case, as well potential evidence was left (in the record heat) for over two weeks. We should all be demanding answers via a thorough investigation.
> -The NYPD is victim blaming in both cases, and the media as well public officials who could help amplify these two stories, appear to be sitting in their hands.
> -STARR is in the process of organizing public events in support of both women. To get involved please email info@strategictransalliance.org (*or mariah4change@gmail.com)
