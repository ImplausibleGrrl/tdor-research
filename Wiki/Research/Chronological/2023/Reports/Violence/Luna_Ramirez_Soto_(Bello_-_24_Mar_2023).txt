> The body of this person was left lying on the spot and before the astonished gaze of the neighbors, the agents of the Sijín of the Metropolitan Police carried out the inspection of the corpse.
> 
> At first they did not find documentation, but in the identification work of Legal Medicine it was possible to fully establish who it was. However, her neighbors had already referred to her with the nickname that she was known in the community, although they did not know her name.
> 
> Little is known of the attack. Some people pointed out that they had seen her walk the streets of the neighborhood and lie down in the front gardens of the houses, so it is being investigated if this fact was related to an act of intolerance.
> 
> This is the eighth homicide that has been registered this year in Bello, according to the records of the authorities. In 2022, to date, there were five cases and in 2021 there were already 14.




> March 24, 2023.  Luna Ramírez Soto, a trans woman from Bello, Antioquia, had her throat cruelly slit while she was sleeping on a sidewalk in the Rosalpi neighborhood, in a completely defenseless state. According to her community, she was a calm woman who had no problems or threats and who collected recycling as a way to support herself. According to preliminary witness reports, her killer escaped through the streets of the La Mesa neighborhood. For the Affirmative Caribbean Human Rights Observatory, Luna is the fourteenth LGBTIQ+ person murdered in Colombia in 2023, and the fifth in the department of Antioquia.
> 
> For this reason, from Caribe Afirmativo  we request that a working group be convened to analyze and take action on the events that occurred, in addition to the application of the good practice guide that Caribe Afirmativo worked with the Attorney General's Office to investigate these events with gender approach,  determining the possible motive for the murder, confirming or not that it is motivated by the sexual orientation of the victim.
> 
> We stand in solidarity with the community of Luna and we hope that they receive promptness and promptness from justice in the investigation. LGBTIQ+ lives are very significant and deserve support, protection, reparation and an end to impunity.
