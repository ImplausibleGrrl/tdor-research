> The Civil Police of Maringá confirmed on the morning of last Monday, 30, that it is working on more than one front of investigations that may help to understand the crime that resulted in the murder of Samantha Campana, 23 years old.
> 
> The main suspect is that the robbery attempt was made by a street resident. However, the police are not ruling out other possibilities. Contradictions arose between the testimony of the main witness and security camera footage that recorded the perpetrator of the crime.
> 
> A friend of the young woman, who witnessed the crime, reported that the suspect was without a shirt and was wearing light-colored shorts with a red mark, and had characteristics of a homeless person.
> 
> However, security camera footage revealed that the individual was wearing a gray T-shirt and white, unbranded shorts of another color. Furthermore, he apparently did not have the profile of being a homeless person.
>
