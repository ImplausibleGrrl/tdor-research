stabbed
[victim was cisgender, but perceived as trans]



He believed this woman was a Trans woman and was infuriated because she was sitting at a gazebo at her apartment. I don't know yet if she was Trans or not, but his belief that she was (as well as him being a racist) was enough for him to brutally murder her.

> RICHMOND, Ind. — More details have come to light in connection to the death of a woman in Richmond this week.
> 
> Tommy Wayne Earl, 67, is currently being held in the Wayne County Jail where he has been preliminarily charged with murder and other charges related to the death of a woman at an apartment complex in Richmond.
> 
> Richmond Police Department officers were dispatched on Friday, June 30, to Merle Henderson Apartments on 81 S. 14th Street around 1:40 p.m. in response to an apparent homicide that had just taken place.

> A caller had told dispatch that a man possessing a knife had been threatening a woman in the area and that the woman was in serious danger.

> When officers located the suspect, a struggle ensued. The affidavit said Earl was armed with a straight razor and was described as having “blood on his hands as well as his clothing,” when officers first made contact.
> 
> Earl allegedly ignored commands to drop the weapon and comply with responding officers. Officers subsequently deployed Tasers to take the subject into custody. Earl reportedly told one of the responding officers that he would kill him too, the affidavit said. Earl continued to resist the advances of law enforcement until he was subdued, taken into custody and transported to Reid Hospital.

When asked if he walked behind the victim, Earl confirmed he approached the victim face-to-face and swung the razor in an attempt to cut her throat.
> 
> A witness was also inside the gazebo at the time of the incident, according to the affidavit. Earl reportedly told the other witness “he was not there for her.” Earl then exited the gazebo and had several bystanders attempt to subdue him, even being struck by tools nearby lawn care workers were using.
