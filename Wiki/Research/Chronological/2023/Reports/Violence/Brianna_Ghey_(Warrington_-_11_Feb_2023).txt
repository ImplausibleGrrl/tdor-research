> 
> Brianna Ghey, 16, was found dead by members of the public on a path in Culcheth's Linear Park, popular with dog-walkers, by members of the public at around 3.13pm Saturday (February 11). She had spoken to her mum earlier that day, but detectives said it was "too early to say" what the teenager was doing in the area and whether she had been to meet anyone.

> Brianna was killed in a "targeted attack" and there was "no wider risk to the public" according to Detective Chief Superintendent Mike Evans, of Cheshire Police.

> Locals told the ECHO forensic investigators and dog search teams appeared to be scouring an open field between the park and Clifton Avenue, where a few strands of police tape remained fluttering in the breeze. In the far distance behind the treeline, uniformed officers were still visible searching the area on Sunday evening.
> 
> One resident living opposite the field said: "You do hope they catch them. I was just getting out of the car on my way hope from work when I saw the air ambulance landing in the field.
> 
> "They started clearing people off the field with armed police, and you could see them searching with dogs throughout yesterday and today."
> 
> Another local told the ECHO: "The killer has to be local, you would have to know the area to be in that park. There are a lot of ways in and it splits into two levels where there was a railway track, it will be hard to track where they went."
> 
> DCS Evans said earlier: "It's a tragic and shocking set of circumstances which have unfortunately led to a 16-year-old girl losing her life, but I would like to reassure the community there are an awful lot of detectives working on this and we've got an increased presence in the area.
> 
> "You'll see lots of police officers out and about and community support officers. If you do have any concerns please go up to them, speak to them, and please don't speculate at this time."
> 
> Cheshire Police are seeking two people seen in the park around the time Brianna's body was found. DCS Evans described them as a white man and woman, in their late teens or early twenties, both with dark curly hair. The man was wearing a longish dark hooded coat and the woman had a distinctive red or purple, black checked blanket-style coat and a long flowing skirt, dress or trousers.
> 
> The force is also keen to speak to anyone who was in the park from around 1.30pm until 4.00pm yesterday or anyone who may have seen Brianna in the hours leading up to her death
> 
> Information can be shared with the investigation team online here or by calling 101, quoting reference IML 1476832.
> 
> Information can also be reported anonymously, via Crimestoppers, on 0800 555 111.

>

Her name was Brianna Ghey. She was 16. She was murdered. Stabbed to death. The local police are obfuscating that this was an anti-trans hate crime. British media coverage is ignoring that she was trans. Because of the success of TERF/GC fascists, she won't be buried as herself. Her death certificate and headstone, by British law, will misgender and erase her. This is what all TERF/GCs want:  Total elimination and erasure of trans people. 
Was your crappy wizard simulator worth her life?

#DignityForBrianna 

Brianna Ghey, a transgender girl who was brutally murdered will will not be given dignity in death and will be misgendered on her death certificate thanks to an outdated gender recognition act that the UK government has refused to reform.

The UK government can stop this from happening and can give Brianna that dignity.  The UK government, members of the Labour party and the UK media can stop its senseless attacks on trans lives.
