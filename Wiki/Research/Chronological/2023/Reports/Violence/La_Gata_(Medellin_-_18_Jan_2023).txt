> Louvain cries and rejects the murder of 'La Gata', a woman leader of the LGTBI population
> The murder of a leader of trans women in the Leuven sector has dismayed the neighbors, who assure that she was a person dedicated to serving the community.
> 
> The streets of Leuven have been lonely, sad and empty. In a house in the sector lived La Gata, as everyone knew her, a woman who for years was the life of this sector, and who was murdered in her own room with a knife.
> 
> Patricia Llano, manager of Diversidades de Medellín, rejected the violent act that mourned an entire population and even more so for what she represented for the LGTBI population.
> 
> La Gata was a mother, a woman who helped hundreds of people, and an investigation process began with the Prosecutor's Office to quickly find the whereabouts of the person responsible in a short time.
> 
> Those who knew her say that her only desire in life was to help others, for more than 40 years she lived in the same residence, where she rented rooms temporarily.
> 
> According to the authorities, this is the first homicide of a trans person that has been registered this year in the country and that sets off the alarms of these people in the city of Medellín. Last year there were nine homicides of which 65% were already clarified by the authorities.
> 
> For Jaquess León, leader and Human Rights Defender of the LGTBI population, the homicide is regrettable.
> 
> We are dismayed by the streak of homicides, 18 days have passed since 2023 and this is the first of the LGTBI population.
> 
> It is worth remembering that a reward of up to 200 million pesos was announced in the city for anyone who provides information that makes it possible to find those responsible for this type of violent act in the district.
