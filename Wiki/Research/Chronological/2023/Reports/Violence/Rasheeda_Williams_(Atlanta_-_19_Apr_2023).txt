> 
> Rasheeda Williams, a Black trans woman and performing artist better known by her stage names Koko Da Doll and Hollywood Koko, was shot and killed in Atlanta, GA on Wednesday night. She was 35 years old.
> 
> According to reporting in Gaye Magazine, Atlanta police have confirmed that a person was shot on the corner of Martin Luther King Jr. Dr. SW and Hamilton E. Holmes NW late Wednesday. Police sources did not confirm Williams’ identity, but friends and family stated that she was the victim in social media posts obtained by the magazine. No details about the killing have been made public at this time.
> 
> Williams’ violent death was also confirmed in an Instagram post by LGBTQ+ advocate Daniella Carter, with whom Williams starred in filmmaker D. Smith’s latest documentary Kokomo City. “I’m truly at a lost of words and in deep pain,” Carter wrote, sharing an image of Williams on the red carpet at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year.
> 
> In addition to being a trans sex worker, which she discussed at length in Kokomo City, Williams was a rapper, releasing her first single “Trick” in 2020 followed by 2022’s “Bulletproof.” She was also working on new music, as she teased in a vlog last year.
> 
> “Koko had a heart of gold and spread nothing but love and light to those she came across,” Williams’ family wrote in the description of their GoFundMe campaign to pay for funeral costs. “To know Koko is to love her, she loved her family and friends to the core of her heart.” At time of writing, the campaign had raised roughly half of its $15,000 goal.
> 
> Williams’ death marks at least the tenth violent killing of a trans person in the U.S. this year, per numbers maintained by Pittsburgh Lesbian Correspondents. Her murder comes less than two weeks after Ashley Burton was also shot to death in Atlanta. No arrests in that case have been made public. And in January, Georgia state police shot nonbinary activist Tortuguita — who was protesting the development of a police training facility colloquially called “Cop City” — at least 57 times.
