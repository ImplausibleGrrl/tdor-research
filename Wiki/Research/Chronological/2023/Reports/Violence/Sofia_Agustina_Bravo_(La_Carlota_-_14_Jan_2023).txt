January 15, 2023

After 8 days of intense search, members of the Police and the Córdoba Fire Department found yesterday the corpse of Sofía Agustina Bravo (26) in an advanced state of decomposition in a pasture located next to the roundabout at the entrance to the town of La Carlota . .

The discovery occurred on Saturday at 5:00 pm, in the middle of a search, and now the Judicial Police of Río Cuarto is carrying out an autopsy to determine the causes of death.

"As part of the search operation for Sofia Agustina Bravo, in the rural area near La Carlota, a lifeless body was found on provincial route 4 ," the Public Prosecutor's Office (MPF) confirmed to the local press.

The 26-year-old girl was last seen on Friday the 6th in the afternoon when she had to travel from the city of La Carlota to her mother's house in Marcos Juárez, but never reached her destination.

That day she was wearing white jean shorts, black sneakers with white soles, a black tank top with sequins in the same color on the front, and a small black canvas backpack.

According to official sources, the trace of her cell phone located her in a place on the outskirts of the city of La Carlota, which was not reported due to summary secrecy.

Investigators reported that Sofía worked as a sex worker and among the different theories about her death, there is a clue that indicates that before disappearing she had gotten into a truck. In fact, the night before she disappeared , she had been seen meeting with truckers at the intersection of National Route 8 and Provincial Route 4.

Although the investigators suspect a crime, they await the results of the autopsy that will be released this Sunday to confirm it.

The search for Sofía had been disclosed by the Public Prosecutor's Office and by the organization Ni Una Menos. In the last hours, the association of prostitutes, Ammar, had also joined.

Last Thursday, this organization had released a strong statement in relation to the disappearance of Anahí Bulnes , a case that the Justice of Córdoba had already labeled as a femicide despite the fact that her body was not found.

Taking into account that the judicial hypothesis points to Anahí being murdered in the framework of her sex work, Ammar once again insisted on the need for this activity to be regulated so that the people who carry it out can carry it out in safer conditions, with less vulnerabilities. It is the same context that is now beginning to emerge behind the death of Sofía in La Carlota.

Anahí was last seen when she entered the home of Santiago Campos Mattos, located on Olmos Avenue and Guzmán Boulevard, in the Cordoba capital, on December 5.

The city's security cameras recorded the man when he met the teacher, who is also a sex worker, at the corner of Avenida Emilio Olmos and Salta in the early morning of that day. Then another camera detected them both entering his apartment, but she is never seen leaving it again.

For the fact there is a suspect arrested for homicide and in whose apartment the blood of the woman who is still being sought was found.






A 26-year-old girl who had disappeared on January 6 when she was traveling to her mother's house in Marcos Juárez was found dead in a field in the Cordovan district of La Carlota .

"As part of the search operation for Sofia Agustina Bravo , in the rural area near La Carlota, a lifeless body was found on provincial route 4," it was officially reported.

The body in a state of decomposition was found on Saturday afternoon among the pastures located next to the roundabout at the entrance to the Cordoba town.

The case is in the hands of the judicial police of Río Cuarto and this Sunday an autopsy will be carried out to determine the cause of his death.
