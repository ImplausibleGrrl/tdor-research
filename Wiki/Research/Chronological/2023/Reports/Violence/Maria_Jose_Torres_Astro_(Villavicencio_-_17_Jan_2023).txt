> 
> The journalist and porn actress Amaranta Hank is one of those who has taken the spokesperson for the case to denounce and help to resolve the case.
> 
> According to her, the trans woman was found lifeless at her home , located in the Mavicure urbanization in the city of Villavicencio.
> 
> Fulfilling the call of the public, the uniformed officers of the Criminal Investigation Section (SIJIN) carried out the technical inspection and other acts when they arrived at the scene, where they discovered that the victim had a knife buried in his chest.
> 
> The causes of death are still under investigation. However, those close to the victim assure that she was murdered and that it is not a suicide as they want to show.
> 
> “Majo was a trans woman, webcam model, businesswoman and friend. She was murdered in her home in Villavicencio on Tuesday, January 17, one day after her 33rd birthday, her body was found with a knife buried in her chest. The authorities came and dared to say that it could be a suicide. What cynicism! ”, Amaranta expressed on her Twitter account.
> 
> “It was her bosses and her neighbor who handed over information to the authorities and even a video with the face of the main suspect who, by the way, is free, like her sentimental partner who mistreated her. Her mother, an elderly woman, was given her body without any explanation of death. It is not known if she struggled with the killer or if she was mistreated in other ways before or after she was killed. What has prevented the investigation from advancing? That she was a trans woman? That she worked as a webcam model? That her mother was an older woman who couldn't make any more claims? That in a small town everything goes quiet?” she added.

> February 3, 2023. The murder of María José Torres Astros has generated rejection among her community. On January 18, 2023, the body of this 33-year-old businesswoman was found with a stab wound to her chest from ella in her house from ella in the PMaría José Torres Astroneighborhood, in Villavicencio.
> 
> According to the local outlet El Cuarto Mosquetero, Viviana Palacios, Villavicencio's Secretary for Women, rejected this murder and called on the authorities to treat her as transfemicide. This call was joined by Raiza Parra, a trans woman human rights defender, stressing that this is the second homicide of an LGBTIQ+ person in Meta in 2023. On social networks, the authorities have been sued to provide an effective response to this case using the hashtag #JusticiaParaMajo.
> 
> Therefore, the Office of the Attorney General of the Nation is required to quickly investigate this case, based on the possibility that it is a case of homicide motivated by prejudiced motives regarding the gender identity of María José. In all the events registered against LGBTIQ+ people there must be an analysis that includes the possibility of violence due to prejudice towards people with diverse sexual orientations, identities and gender expressions.
> 
> From Caribe Afirmativo we request that a working group be convened to analyze and take action on the facts, applying the guide to good practices that we developed with the Prosecutor's Office for the investigation of these facts with a gender approach that allows establishing if they had an origin of violence based on prejudice towards the sexual orientation, identity or gender expression of the victims.
