> The news was released through social networks that Liliana Veroni, "La Chaqueña", a 65-year-old trans woman, was the victim of a hate crime on Avenida Monteverde, in Rafael Calzada. Despite repeated calls from the neighbors, the ambulance and the police took 45 minutes to arrive at the scene and La Chaqueña died at the scene as a result of the injuries received.
> 
> The crime in La Chaqueña exposes once again the abandonment of the health system and the State to transvestites and trans people. Currently, 73% of said population does not have access to education, 98% do not have formal work and 80% survive through prostitution. The trans labor quota does not apply : the latest data shows that of 7,318 people who applied, only 574 agreed, many of them as monotributistas.

> Owen Luna, pre-candidate for councilor for Esteban Echeverria, declared that: "From the PTS in the Left Front we propose that it is in the streets where we have to fight violence and discrimination. So that the health system is financed and the attention to all transvestite and trans compañeros, it is necessary to ignore the external debt. We fight so that secular and scientific ESI is implemented throughout the country. As we did on June 28 with Pan and Rosas, in the eighth march against transvesticides and transfemicides, independently of the governments. We demand justice for the Chaco and all the compañeras victims of hate crimes and the abandonment of the State".
