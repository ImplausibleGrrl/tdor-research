> The Quito Trans Psychological Center of the Silueta X Association, members of the National Platform "New Trans Ecuador Network" (which covers rural, community and periphery areas with its collectives), the GLBTI Observatory, and the National Federation of LGBT Organizations, publicly disclose the following fact.
> 
> Keyly Daniela Macías Cortés, 25 years old from the city of Guayaquil, was murdered after being beaten with mitts and apparently having her throat slit. According to unofficial information to which we have accessed, Keyly was with two more friends who received an individual, the same person who would have beaten all three of them and had been merciless with Keyly, who was finally murdered. In addition, we know unofficially that he was arrested. Keyly, days ago, would have made a public complaint in which the civil registry did not intend to hand over her passport for an emergency trip to Panama City, Panama.
> 
> For all of the above, we call on the State Attorney General, Diana Salazar, the Police Commander, Carlos Cabrera, the Undersecretary for Diversities Alexander Guano, the Ecuadorian Ombudsman (e), Cesar Córdoba Valverde, to carry out the necessary coordination to find the culprit or culprits, of this fact that mourns our community.
> 
> The Runa Sipiy Report of the Silueta X Association, on transfemicides, unresolved violent deaths or suspected criminality, registers this case as the sixth of this 2023, against our LGBT+ populations nationwide. During the year 2022, we close our report, which we have compiled since 2012, with close to 25 LGBT+ murders, transfemicides, unresolved violent deaths or suspected criminality.
