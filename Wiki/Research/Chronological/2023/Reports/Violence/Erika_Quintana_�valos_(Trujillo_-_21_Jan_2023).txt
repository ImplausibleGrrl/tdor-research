burned
[found in a burnt out car]



> Two hate crimes made invisible by the protests: a trans woman burned in La Libertad and another murdered in Arequipa
> The hate killings occurred in less than a week, while the country is experiencing a social and institutional crisis. The organization More Equality demanded that crimes have "specific penalties to reach justice"
> January 25, 2023
>
> In less than a week, the country registered two hate crimes that were made invisible by the protests against the administration of Dina Boluarte and the institutional crisis, while the Executive and Legislative branches review the bill that proposes advancing the general elections to April 2024 .
> 
> More Equality reported that the cases occurred in Moche (La Libertad) and in Camaná (Arequipa). The victims, two trans women, were identified as Erika Quintana Ávalos , whose body was burned in a car three days ago, and Ale Castillo Limache , whose remains were located this Tuesday in a hostel in the "white city."
> 
> Érika 's hate crime is the one with the most clues, as the National Police (PNP) is investigating three suspects, including the taxi driver, who is unlocatable, reported Sol TV. Meanwhile, Ale's relatives asked for justice outside the morgue, according to images shared by Camaná Go.
> “The State continues to violate the rights of people and trampling on the identities of our compañeras. Hate crimes exist and they have to have specific penalties to reach justice," the feminist organization remarked.
> 
> The pronouncement comes amid the demonstrations for the resignation of Boluarte , which have so far left 56 dead, including a policeman, after six weeks of political and social crisis marked by roadblocks and protests in different parts of the country.
> 
> Although there are no official statistics on violence against the LGTBI community in Peru , a study by the Public Ministry published in 2022 —'Criminological characteristics of intentional deaths of LGTB people in Peru 2012-2021'— offers an approximation of the nature of these murders.
> 
> The investigation analyzed 84 cases in which 88 people died violently, and found that 45.5% of the tax investigations had no information on the possible motives for said crimes.
> Of the remaining 45.5%, only 2.2% indicated gender identity and sexual orientation as presumed causes, despite the fact that, in at least 68.4% of cases, they did show signs of violence due to prejudice, according to the evidence evaluated by study specialists.
> 
> Impossibility of investigating a bias crime
> "When an LGBT person is murdered, something should be done that even the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IDH Cote) establishes: prejudice must be considered as a possible cause of the murder," Ho Amat y León , in charge of the murder, told Ojo Público . of the LGTB Rights Observatory of the Cayetano Heredia Private University, entity that participated in the research.
>  
> “In Peru it is overlooked that they are LGBT people, it is not even taken as relevant information. This removes the possibility of it being investigated as a bias crime. It is registered as one more murder, ”he continued.
> For his part, Alejandro Merino , founder of the Association of Families for Sexual Diversity , told Infobae that hate crimes do not usually reach justice because there is no regulation that condemns this type of crime.
> 
> “Unfortunately, at the national level there is no type of conviction that is based on the sexual orientation or gender identity of the victim. That is one of the reasons why hate crimes do not receive the corresponding sanction ”, he pointed out.
> 
> In 2017, the Executive Branch issued Legislative Decree No. 1323, which incorporated sexual orientation and gender identity as aggravating circumstances to punish the commission of criminal offences, and as typical assumptions in the crime of discrimination and incitement to discrimination.
> Four years ago, in 2013, Congress refused to incorporate sexual orientation and gender identity as an aggravating circumstance in crimes of discrimination in the debate on the Law against hate crimes, which would reform the Penal Code.


> Trujillo: body burned in Moche is a transsexual
> January 21, 2023
> The body burned in Moche was not that of a woman; but of a transsexual whose identity is still unknown. The National Police is investigating three suspects, including the taxi driver who is unlocatable.
