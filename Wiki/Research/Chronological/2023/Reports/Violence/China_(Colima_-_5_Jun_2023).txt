> Another trans woman is murdered in Colima; They add up to 5 so far this year 
> 
> COLIMA, Col. (apro) She is missing in the municipality of Tecomán, said activist Marco Antonio Pérez Gaspar, former adviser to the Colima State Human Rights Commission (CDHEC).
> 
> He warned that during the first five months of 2023 violence against the trans community in Colima intensified, since in this period the number of five transfeminicides that occurred throughout 2022 was already equaled.
> 
> Related news
> Yesterday afternoon, in front of the Los Rojos suburban terminal of this capital, located on Rodolfo Chávez Carrillo boulevard, two women were shot dead, one of them transgender known as La China, who lived in the El Tívoli neighborhood.
> 
> One of the victims died instantly at the scene of the attack, while the other ceased to exist when the Red Cross paramedics arrived.
> 
> Likewise, on May 17, State Day against Homophobia, the body of Natasha, a trans woman who had been missing for a month, was found in the vicinity of the Alpuyequito canal, while on the previous March 31 another murder was found in a house in the neighborhood Gustavo Vázquez Montes, south of the city of Colima.
> 
> Two other trans women were murdered in the municipality of Tecomán, one of them known as Joseline, who was attacked while riding her motorcycle on Lázaro Cárdenas street, and the other case also occurred in the municipal capital.
> 
> In that same city, on the morning of April 23, Giovana disappeared while leaving a nightclub and to date her relatives do not know her whereabouts.
> 
> Marco Antonio Pérez commented that several of the victims were engaged in sex work, given the job insecurity, rejection, and lack of opportunities faced by those who make up this sector of society.
> 
> "Unfortunately there are no public policies on the part of government institutions to protect trans women from the upsurge in violence, especially in these months against homophobia and gay pride," said the activist.
> 
> He considered that the state government would have to start working on the implementation of programs aimed at addressing the situation of the trans sector, both in terms of employment and social security, since it is the most vulnerable group within the Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender community. (LGBT+).
> 
> Pérez Gaspar indicated that just last year two trans women from Colima joined the groups of migrants on the northern border who requested asylum in the United States for reasons of discrimination and insecurity of their personal integrity.
> 
> He stated that in government instances there is still resistance to working on public policies in favor of this sector, since for example only four mayoralties have established free procedures for changing birth certificates based on gender identity: Manzanillo, which was the first, also such as Colima, Villa de Álvarez and Comala.
> 
> "This speaks of the lack of sensitivity and empathy on the part of the councils for this to be done, despite the fact that there is a request from the State Congress made on February 13, but not all have responded." He explained.
