> One of the victims is Everton Josimar de Oliveira, 36 years old, missing since January 9 of this year. His body was found inside the Bosque Uirapuru, in Umuarama.
> 
> The other victim is Fernandes Nunes de Araújo, 50 years old, missing since February 11th. His body was found in a rural area, near Avenida Portugal, also in Umuarama.
> 
> According to Chief of Police Gabriel Menezes, in Guilherme's version, these victims were killed because he believed they were chasing him, in the service of other criminals who tried to kill him for drug debts.
> 
> According to him, changing the version of what he had previously passed on, this was also the reason why he killed the doctor Renan and the victim Alexan. That is, he believed that Renan and Alexan were following in his footsteps at the behest of other criminals who wanted his death. He claimed that he did not know and also never had any relationship with the doctor Renan and that he lied when he told the first version.

> By Luiz de Carvalho  February 24, 2023 in Police
> 
> The same man who killed doctor Renan Tortajada, 35, with a stone in the early hours of Friday and Saturday, and transvestite Sabrina (Alexan Carlos Goes), 44, in Umuarama, confessed to having killed two other men, one of them just over a week ago and another at the end of December. The doctor's murderer may have committed other murders in the Umuarama region.
> 
> Guilherme da Costa Alves, 26 years old, was arrested in Umuarama last Sunday, the 19th, when the police forces were mobilized to locate the doctor Renan dos Santos Tortajada, who had left Toledo on Friday night to spend the Carnival with the family in Maringá, his city of origin.

> Doctor Renan Tortajada in his work environment Photo: Social networks
> Trapped with the doctor's car, he ended up confessing that he had killed Jean and buried him in a shallow ditch in Bosque Uirapuru, a few meters from where he had committed the murder with a stone. He also confessed that he had beaten the transvestite Sabrina to death, who had seen the doctor's murder.
> 
> In recent days, the Civil Police investigated Guilherme's activities and he ended up confessing that he was a motorcycle thief and that he had killed two people to steal the motorcycles. He indicated the places where he had hidden the bodies and this Friday the two corpses were found and taken to the Legal Medical Institute (IML) for expertise.
> One of the bodies was buried on Estrada dos Pássaros, in the rural area of ??Umuarama, and the other was in Bosque Uirapuru, about 200 meters from the place where the body of doctor Renan Tortajada was found on Sunday.





> Accused of killing doctor and transvestite says he killed 2 other people and buried the bodies
> 02/24/2023 21:29
> 
> Jornal Ilustrado - Accused of killing doctor and transvestite says he killed 2 other people and buried the bodies
> Police officers collect one of the bodies in Bosque Uirapuru
> At least four deaths are being attributed to Guilherme da Costa Alves, 26 years old. Earlier this Friday night (24), two more bodies were found buried in Umuarama. And they have already been identified by the police.
> 
> After an investigative work, the Civil Police arrived at the scene on the advice of Guilherme himself, arrested since Carnival Sunday (19), after confessing to having killed the doctor Renan dos Santos Tortajada, 35 years old, and the public servant and transvestite Alexan Carlos de Goes, to Sabrina Medeiros, 44 years old.
> 
> Police investigate whether the motivation for the deaths pointed out by him are true. And with the number of bodies discovered in just seven days, a question that arises is whether Guilherme Alves would be a serial killer or 'serial killer', in English. Only investigations can answer this question.
> 
> Jornal Ilustrado - Accused of killing doctor and transvestite says he killed 2 other people and buried the bodies
> According to information provided by the Civil Police chief, Gabriel Menezes, one of the victims found yesterday is Everton Josimar de Oliveira, 36, missing since 01/09/2023. His body was found inside the Bosque Uirapuru, in Umuarama.
> 
> The other victim is Fernandes Nunes de Araújo, 50 years old, missing since 02/11/2023. His body was found in a rural area, near Av. Portugal, municipality of Umuarama. The two victims lived in the municipality of Umuarama and the disappearances occurred and were also registered here in the city.
> 
> Jornal Ilustrado - Accused of killing doctor and transvestite says he killed 2 other people and buried the bodies
> The bodies were sent to the IML and are awaiting recognition by family members, in order to confirm whether the identities are those preliminarily raised by the Civil Police. The confirmation of identities also depends on the conclusion of the works of the Scientific Police.
> 
> Still according to the police, the two victims found yesterday had their motorcycles subtracted by the criminal. One of the motorcycles, a Honda Twister, owned by the victim Fernandes Nunes de Araújo, was recovered by the Civil Police, in a workshop located in Zone VII, in Umuarama. The other victim's motorcycle has not yet been located.
> 
> The police reported that the investigations that culminated in the location of the corpses had been ongoing since the disappearance of the victims. However, after the arrest of the man who killed Renan and Alexan, on 02/19/2023, new information reached the Civil Police and added to those that had already been raised.
> 
> The gathering of all this information pointed out that the person responsible for the disappearances could also be the same author. In view of this, the prisoner was again heard by the police team and, given the evidence presented to him, he decided to collaborate and confessed to the crimes, leading the police to the places where the bodies were found.
> 
> Menezes pointed out that, according to what has been determined so far, none of these deaths are linked. These are autonomous crimes, committed on different dates and places. And finally, he clarified that so far there is no information on other deaths that have been committed by the same author.
> 
> He also said that the author presented more than one version of the crimes and all of them are being investigated.
> 
> Tortajada case
> 
> Doctor Renan Tortajada disappeared on the night of Friday (17) during Carnival, on the way between Toledo, where he lived, and Maringá, where his family lives. On Saturday morning, friends and family located his broken cell phone, around Lake Aratimbó. There began a search that ended tragically on Sunday, when the doctor's body was found. Guilherme Alves was arrested by the Military Police driving the victim's car, a Honda Civic, near Bosque Uirapuru, late Sunday morning (19). After being arrested, he ended up confessing to the death of doctor Renan and also of transvestite Sabrina Medeiros.
> 
> According to the Civil Police, Renan Tortajada died after a disagreement with Guilherme. The doctor was stoned to death inside the woods, where he was buried. The two would have known each other for about a year.
> 
> Afterwards, Guilherme would have killed Sabrina Medeiros. The first information is that the transvestite died because she witnessed the doctor's death, but this is still a point to be clarified. Her body was found half-naked on a road in the rural area of ??Maria Helena on Saturday (18), after popular complaints. The version presented by Guilherme himself is that she was beaten to death, placed in the trunk of the vehicle and taken to the neighboring municipality, where she was abandoned.
> 
> Also according to the Civil Police, after the deaths of Renan and Sabrina, the killer would have gone to Moreira Sales, where he would have left the doctor's notebook and documents pawned in exchange for money, which would characterize robbery, which carries a penalty of 20 to 30 years in prison.
> 
> As Guilherme is under arrest, the Civil Police, legally, the deadline for concluding investigations into the case of the doctor and the transvestite is until the 2nd of March.



> Pediatrician and transvestite were brutally murdered in Umuarama
> The transvestite was dumped in Maria Helena by the suspect, who confessed to having executed and buried the doctor's body inside the forest in Umuarama
>
> The Military Police (PM) of Umuarama passed on more information about the two bodies that were found this Saturday night (18) and early Sunday afternoon (19) in the municipalities of Maria Helena and Umuarama, respectively. At first, the two deaths were committed by the same suspect, who was arrested later this afternoon.
> 
> According to information passed on by Lieutenant Ramalho, from the 25th Battalion, in a press conference this afternoon, the Military Police, the BPFron (Border Operations Battalion), Municipal Guard and Civil Police began searches to find the whereabouts of doctor Renan Tortejada – who disappeared during the journey from Toledo to Maringá, passing through Umuarama – since they received information that the doctor's cell phone had been found in Lake Aratimbó and that his vehicle, a lead-colored Honda Civic, would be transiting Umuarama.
> 
> In parallel with the searches, the police received information about a body that had been found in a rural area of Maria Helena and that would have been dumped by a vehicle with the characteristics of the Civic that belonged to the doctor. The team went to the location and found the body of a transvestite, which was collected by the IML of Umuarama and so far has not been identified.
> 
> It was then that at the end of the morning of this Sunday (19) with the help of family members who monitored the information that Renan's Civic would be in the city, the police managed to approach the vehicle on Avenida Duque de Caxias, close to Tiro de Guerra, which was being occupied by two suspects.
> 
> In conversation with the police, the driver – who had an open arrest warrant for robbery – confessed to committing the two crimes: both the homicide of the body that was found in Maria Helena, and the homicide involving Tortejada. He also pointed out to the police that he had buried the doctor from Toledo in Bosque Uirapuru, near the wall of the Lúcio Pipino stadium.
> 
> The Military Police, accompanied by the Civil Police Criminalistics teams and experts from the Legal Medical Institute of Umuarama, went to the designated location and there they found a lifeless body, which in principle would be that of Renan.
> 
> The author of the crime told the Military Police that he would have made an appointment with the doctor in Bosque Uirapuru, and, after a disagreement with the doctor, he would have executed him and buried his body inside the forest. The victim that was found in Maria Helena would be a person who would have witnessed the murder and therefore was also killed by the suspect.
> 
> The second occupant of the vehicle, according to the author, would be a person he would have sought in the municipality of Goioerê. Both were forwarded to the 7th Police Subdivision of Umuarama.




> Second victim identified who witnessed death of Toledo doctor
> Body was found on Saturday night (18), on a rural road in Maria Helena
> February 20, 2023 | 16:16
> 
> The body that was found on Saturday night (18), on a rural road in Maria Helena, has been identified. This is Alexan Carlos de Goes, 43 years old, known as Sabrina. He was a former municipal and state councilor for Social Assistance.
> 
> The victim witnessed the death of doctor Renan Tortajada, in the early hours of Saturday, at Bosque Uirapuru, in Umuarama. Alexan was found naked and covered by branches in a wooded area. According to the 26-year-old man who confessed to the murder, the victim was also beaten to death in the woods.
> 
> The Civil Police reported that the transvestite was passing by the scene, saw what happened, tried to run, but was overtaken by the criminal.
> 
> Afterwards, the doctor's car, a Honda Civic, was used to take the body on a rural road in the municipality of Maria Helena. The corpse was found after a resident, knowing about the case of the missing doctor, reported that he saw the same car next to a carrier in the region.
> 
> Initially, the suspicion was that Alexan had been run over and the crime hidden, but after the arrest of the 26-year-old man, on Sunday morning, he confessed to the authorship of the two crimes.


> Aline Medeiros (Sabrina) was murdered. The killer also killed the doctor Renan Tortajada during a meeting in the woods, and after being arrested the police said he killed Sabrina because she witnessed the crime, but more developments of the case disproves the story, check it out. (Note, at the time of this profile posted she identified as Aline, in the matter she is called Sabrina, the name she currently used. )
> Guilherme da Costa Alves, 26, lied to police by saying he killed the transvestite in the Uirapuru forest because she witnessed him burying the body of doctor Renan Tortajada, 35. The version is from a friend of Alexan Carlos de Goes, Sabrina Medeiros, 44 years old.
> The friend said she saw the moment Guilherme drove by a Honda Civic lead on Governor Ney Braga Street and invited Sabrina to get in the vehicle.
> "First he passed by me, calling me to go out, but I already knew him, because he's always ready for us." I tried to warn her (Sabrina) I screamed but didn't have time. She didn't listen and went in the car with him. It was about two o'clock in the morning on Saturday (18), said Obemdito, on condition of anonymity.
> Long time client
> The transvestite also reported that Guilherme was a former client. "Both me and my friends have already made a program with him. When he came to us, always on foot or bike, he was a person. After the show ended, I took on a different personality. Became extremely aggressive tryna kill us I almost fell victim to him myself with a knife to my neck. Looked like he was on heavy drugs. That's why he was burned in the middle".
> Information obtained by OBemdito is that Alexan, during the day, worked as a civil servant in Umuarama and at night disguised as Sabrina for better financial gains. She was seen as a cheerful and companion person. "She already lived with us and then went to live alone." She told us she had come from Londrina". Alexan was struggling to walk after a car accident.
> Guilherme da Costa Alves confessed to having killed Renan Tortajada and Alexan Carlos de Goes after being arrested on Duque de Caixas Avenue with the doctor's car. The boy already had police passes for theft, possession and drug trafficking.
> Police admitted to having killed Tortajada with punches and blows from a pointed stone weighing about 1kg in the inner Uirapuru forest. He dragged the body for about 30 meters to the wall of Lucio Pipino's stadium, where he buried him in a grave he himself said he opened, alone.
> Guilherme reported, quite coldly, that he had a relationship with the doctor for just over a year and that at the meeting last Friday (17th) night, he had a disagreement with the victim, because of R$ 200. This is the price that may have cost the life of a respected professional in his job.
> Tortajada was pediatrician and psychiatrist. I attended, among others, the Psychosocial Attention Center (Caps) in Toledo and also in the municipality of Guaíra.
> Alexan was killed with sticks in the confessed killer's version. He collected the body of the transvestite, put it in the trunk of the Honda Civic and took it, semi-naked, to a low-moving area of the neighboring municipality of Maria Helena, covering the corpse with tree branches.
> Alexan's body was the first to be found by police on Saturday night. Upon viewing the report published by OBemdito, about the doctor's disappearance, a witness kept in touch with police and said she saw a person in a Honda Civic throwing something into the matagal.
> Guilherme has done more This Saturday night, in possession of the car of the doctor Tortajada, the alleged member of the Red Command, as reported in testimony, tried to steal a 69-year-old woman, trying to put her, by force, inside the vehicle. The victim was walking with two puppies in the street from her home. The woman managed to disable herself and sustained injuries to her mouth and knees.
