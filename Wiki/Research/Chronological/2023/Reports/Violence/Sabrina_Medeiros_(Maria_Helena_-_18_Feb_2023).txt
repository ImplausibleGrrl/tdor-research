> Pediatrician and transvestite were brutally murdered in Umuarama
> The transvestite was dumped in Maria Helena by the suspect, who confessed to having executed and buried the doctor's body inside the forest in Umuarama
>
> The Military Police (PM) of Umuarama passed on more information about the two bodies that were found this Saturday night (18) and early Sunday afternoon (19) in the municipalities of Maria Helena and Umuarama, respectively. At first, the two deaths were committed by the same suspect, who was arrested later this afternoon.
> 
> According to information passed on by Lieutenant Ramalho, from the 25th Battalion, in a press conference this afternoon, the Military Police, the BPFron (Border Operations Battalion), Municipal Guard and Civil Police began searches to find the whereabouts of doctor Renan Tortejada – who disappeared during the journey from Toledo to Maringá, passing through Umuarama – since they received information that the doctor's cell phone had been found in Lake Aratimbó and that his vehicle, a lead-colored Honda Civic, would be transiting Umuarama.
> 
> In parallel with the searches, the police received information about a body that had been found in a rural area of Maria Helena and that would have been dumped by a vehicle with the characteristics of the Civic that belonged to the doctor. The team went to the location and found the body of a transvestite, which was collected by the IML of Umuarama and so far has not been identified.
> 
> It was then that at the end of the morning of this Sunday (19) with the help of family members who monitored the information that Renan's Civic would be in the city, the police managed to approach the vehicle on Avenida Duque de Caxias, close to Tiro de Guerra, which was being occupied by two suspects.
> 
> In conversation with the police, the driver – who had an open arrest warrant for robbery – confessed to committing the two crimes: both the homicide of the body that was found in Maria Helena, and the homicide involving Tortejada. He also pointed out to the police that he had buried the doctor from Toledo in Bosque Uirapuru, near the wall of the Lúcio Pipino stadium.
> 
> The Military Police, accompanied by the Civil Police Criminalistics teams and experts from the Legal Medical Institute of Umuarama, went to the designated location and there they found a lifeless body, which in principle would be that of Renan.
> 
> The author of the crime told the Military Police that he would have made an appointment with the doctor in Bosque Uirapuru, and, after a disagreement with the doctor, he would have executed him and buried his body inside the forest. The victim that was found in Maria Helena would be a person who would have witnessed the murder and therefore was also killed by the suspect.
> 
> The second occupant of the vehicle, according to the author, would be a person he would have sought in the municipality of Goioerê. Both were forwarded to the 7th Police Subdivision of Umuarama.




> Second victim identified who witnessed death of Toledo doctor
> Body was found on Saturday night (18), on a rural road in Maria Helena
> February 20, 2023 | 16:16
> 
> The body that was found on Saturday night (18), on a rural road in Maria Helena, has been identified. This is Alexan Carlos de Goes, 43 years old, known as Sabrina. He was a former municipal and state councilor for Social Assistance.
> 
> The victim witnessed the death of doctor Renan Tortajada, in the early hours of Saturday, at Bosque Uirapuru, in Umuarama. Alexan was found naked and covered by branches in a wooded area. According to the 26-year-old man who confessed to the murder, the victim was also beaten to death in the woods.
> 
> The Civil Police reported that the transvestite was passing by the scene, saw what happened, tried to run, but was overtaken by the criminal.
> 
> Afterwards, the doctor's car, a Honda Civic, was used to take the body on a rural road in the municipality of Maria Helena. The corpse was found after a resident, knowing about the case of the missing doctor, reported that he saw the same car next to a carrier in the region.
> 
> Initially, the suspicion was that Alexan had been run over and the crime hidden, but after the arrest of the 26-year-old man, on Sunday morning, he confessed to the authorship of the two crimes.


> Aline Medeiros (Sabrina) was murdered. The killer also killed the doctor Renan Tortajada during a meeting in the woods, and after being arrested the police said he killed Sabrina because she witnessed the crime, but more developments of the case disproves the story, check it out. (Note, at the time of this profile posted she identified as Aline, in the matter she is called Sabrina, the name she currently used. )
> Guilherme da Costa Alves, 26, lied to police by saying he killed the transvestite in the Uirapuru forest because she witnessed him burying the body of doctor Renan Tortajada, 35. The version is from a friend of Alexan Carlos de Goes, Sabrina Medeiros, 44 years old.
> The friend said she saw the moment Guilherme drove by a Honda Civic lead on Governor Ney Braga Street and invited Sabrina to get in the vehicle.
> "First he passed by me, calling me to go out, but I already knew him, because he's always ready for us." I tried to warn her (Sabrina) I screamed but didn't have time. She didn't listen and went in the car with him. It was about two o'clock in the morning on Saturday (18), said Obemdito, on condition of anonymity.
> Long time client
> The transvestite also reported that Guilherme was a former client. "Both me and my friends have already made a program with him. When he came to us, always on foot or bike, he was a person. After the show ended, I took on a different personality. Became extremely aggressive tryna kill us I almost fell victim to him myself with a knife to my neck. Looked like he was on heavy drugs. That's why he was burned in the middle".
> Information obtained by OBemdito is that Alexan, during the day, worked as a civil servant in Umuarama and at night disguised as Sabrina for better financial gains. She was seen as a cheerful and companion person. "She already lived with us and then went to live alone." She told us she had come from Londrina". Alexan was struggling to walk after a car accident.
> Guilherme da Costa Alves confessed to having killed Renan Tortajada and Alexan Carlos de Goes after being arrested on Duque de Caixas Avenue with the doctor's car. The boy already had police passes for theft, possession and drug trafficking.
> Police admitted to having killed Tortajada with punches and blows from a pointed stone weighing about 1kg in the inner Uirapuru forest. He dragged the body for about 30 meters to the wall of Lucio Pipino's stadium, where he buried him in a grave he himself said he opened, alone.
> Guilherme reported, quite coldly, that he had a relationship with the doctor for just over a year and that at the meeting last Friday (17th) night, he had a disagreement with the victim, because of R$ 200. This is the price that may have cost the life of a respected professional in his job.
> Tortajada was pediatrician and psychiatrist. I attended, among others, the Psychosocial Attention Center (Caps) in Toledo and also in the municipality of Guaíra.
> Alexan was killed with sticks in the confessed killer's version. He collected the body of the transvestite, put it in the trunk of the Honda Civic and took it, semi-naked, to a low-moving area of the neighboring municipality of Maria Helena, covering the corpse with tree branches.
> Alexan's body was the first to be found by police on Saturday night. Upon viewing the report published by OBemdito, about the doctor's disappearance, a witness kept in touch with police and said she saw a person in a Honda Civic throwing something into the matagal.
> Guilherme has done more This Saturday night, in possession of the car of the doctor Tortajada, the alleged member of the Red Command, as reported in testimony, tried to steal a 69-year-old woman, trying to put her, by force, inside the vehicle. The victim was walking with two puppies in the street from her home. The woman managed to disable herself and sustained injuries to her mouth and knees.
