> “She had had a very bitchy life, but she was a happy, flirtatious, smiling girl .” This is how a very close friend defines the personality of Shamira, the 20-year-old girl who died this Thursday from the sudden fall of a palm tree in the Raval .  The accident uncovers the very hard story of an invisible Barcelona , whose life had cruelly treated but she was trying to get ahead.
> 
> Shamira was the daughter of a simple family in Barcelona, from the Sant Martí district . Her mother lost custody when she was young, her father left and the girl - then named Bryan - ended up living with her maternal grandparents along with two stepbrothers. Mental health issues and difficulties fitting in led her to a specialized youth health center, but she couldn't find her place. "She ended up on the street and slept in the Joan Miró park," says the "cousin" Noa , her confidante and the main "reference" she now had. Her grandfather, Carlos, agrees with the fragile life she led and laments that her efforts to "get her back on track" did not bear fruit for her.
> 
> Both have agreed to explain the life trajectory of this young woman to EL PERIÓDICO to raise awareness about the exclusion of the trans collective and denounce that the lack of effective resources pushes dozens of girls like her to bad lives and tragic endings.
> 
> ongoing research
> The Barcelona City Council reviewed the deadly palm tree in March and ruled out that it had an "obvious anomaly"
> Also transsexual, gypsy and in her fifties, Noa was trying to guide Shamira out of the well. Due to age and complicity, she played a kind of maternal role. She accompanied her to psychiatry and they spoke at length at the Metzineres premises, an association of and for trans women on Lluna street, a few meters from Emili Vendrell square, where her fateful palm tree fell. Here they can eat, shower, chat or just hang out in a safe environment.
> 
> "I was about to admit her to a psychiatric unit, I had already convinced her, because she had been very depressed for a while," she says. A fight with her boyfriend and drug use clouded her spirits, although the main cause of the discomfort was the general situation she was living in, Noa laments: "She was bad for the bitch life she's had, because society doesn't like trans people" .
> 
> Carlos, her grandfather, lived with her from the age of 6 to 16: "We have seen her grow." Just as the stepbrothers carried out studies and solid relationships, Shamira constantly encountered vulnerable mental health: "The season that she was hospitalized improved, but when the medication was not taken we had conflicts and being of legal age she could not be forced to do anything ". In recent times she preferred to sleep on the street. Carlos acknowledges that he did not approve of her lifestyle and that he reproached her when they saw each other, despite the "excuses" she gave him.
> 
> The name her best friend gave her
> Shamira wasn't her official name, though she was in the process of changing it and thought she might get it soon. " She was baptized that way by her best friend, with whom they met in a center for minors , she liked her because she has an Arab air," Noa continues. This companion of youth, by the way, was also in the Raval this Thursday, sunk by the loss. There were three twenty-somethings who regularly went to the center and they were very close.

> Shamira's parents separated years ago. Her mother now lives outside of Catalonia and will return to examine the body this Monday. The grandfather denies that her father was Algerian, as several voices around Shamira point out, and he is unnerved that he attributes himself - or she attributed himself - "family neglect". A social worker followed her, although in reality her main support at the moment was Metzineres . Without a roof or financial resources, she met with other girls after sleeping together: "In tents in the Joan Miró park, sometimes also in Montjuïc, although the last three nights she had not gone there."
> 
> Two days before, Noa and Shamira had taken photos together and talked about the future, about living and dying: "I told him to reduce his consumption and to go into a psychiatry and he would get better... I have buried many friends because of AIDS and drug, but she was very young, she could live 10 more years at least!" Grandfather was afraid that one day they would be called with bad news, "an overdose or a knife, but not an accident like this!" He is outraged by the fall of the palm tree, which he attributes to "lack of maintenance" despite the municipal explanations . For now, he points out, no one from the council has called them.
> 
> She went to Raval to get braids
> On Thursday Shamira had gone to Metzineres to have her braids done , a laborious session that she interrupted for a few minutes to go out and run some errands. She precisely went to the Emili Vendrell square and, while standing on the sidewalk, according to what two merchants from Joaquín Costa told this newspaper, the palm tree fell on top of her. The blow was deadly immediately.
> 
> This Friday morning, six very modest candles remembered her, next to the cut base of the tree that killed her. The sidewalk had not yet been thoroughly cleaned, and traces of blood remained on the pavement where she lay. Journalists asked the neighbors who stopped to comment on the case, the blinds of the shops were going up lazily, traffic was low. In the street behind, Metzineres's was padlocked, silent, and emptier than ever.
