> LGTBIQ+ rights in Vietnam
> In August 2022, a great step was taken towards the achievement of LGTBIQ+ rights, since it was stated that being part of this group " is not a disease ". Therefore, it cannot be cured, treatment is not needed, and it cannot be converted in any way. Despite the fact that being homosexual is more accepted by society, trans people continue to suffer discrimination, and, as stated in this testimony, from within the family.
