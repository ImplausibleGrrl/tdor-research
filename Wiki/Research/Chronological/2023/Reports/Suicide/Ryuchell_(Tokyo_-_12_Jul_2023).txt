possible suicide



> Japanese TV personality Ryuchell has been found dead by their manager at the agency's office in Tokyo.
> 
> The 27-year-old's cause of death has not yet been confirmed, but police said they are investigating if they died by suicide.
> 
> Ryuchell married a fellow model, Peco in 2016 and the pair had a son.
> 
> In August 2022, the couple divorced after Ryuchell announced they no longer identified as male, attracting much criticism online.
> 
> In the post shared to Instagram, Ryuchell said they would still live with Peco and their son.
> 
> But many accused the celebrity of being an absent father and criticised their decision to come out. In February, Ryuchell appeared in a YouTube video alongside Peco, who defended her ex-husband and said she supported them as they worked out their sexuality.
> 
> Ryuchell became an influential LGBT figure in Japan and was well-known for their genderless style of dressing. As they became more famous, they were subject to numerous online social harassment campaigns which largely criticised their personal life and gender non-conformity.
> 
> Shortly after their death, terms like "Ryuchell" and "character assassination" started trending on Twitter in Japan.
> 
> Peco and their son are overseas - on Tuesday she posted a picture of a cake for his fifth birthday. The family are yet to comment on news of Ryuchell's death.
