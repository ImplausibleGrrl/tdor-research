> 
> The Twitter account of the Feminist Resistance Movement (a grassroots anti-war organisation originated in Russia) published tragic news about the death of a transgender girl from Russia who committed suicide in a refugee camp in the city of Drachten in the Netherlands.
> 
> A transgender girl from Russia committed suicide in a refugee camp in the Netherlands.  Khina Zakharova applied for asylum in the Netherlands in December 2022.  Earlier, the girl complained that there were serious problems with the queue for hormone replacement therapy in the country.
> 
> Khina Zakharova applied for asylum in the country in December 2022. At the time of the application, she needed hormone replacement therapy, the queue for which in the Netherlands, as Khina was informed, was long, with the approximate waiting period of over two years. The burden of accumulated problems turned out to be unbearable for Khina, resulting in tragedy.
> 
> This terrible case exposes the problem of access to psychological and medical care in refugee camps. Representatives of the LGBTQ+ community are at high risk when it comes to suicide. According to one study, 41 percent of transgender people have attempted suicide. Such risks increase many times over in the situations of extreme uncertainty and stress in which refugees often find themselves.
> 
> Maria (not her real name), an LGBTQ+ activist who left Russia for Europe, believes that the lack of timely psychological support and negative social pressure might be leading causes of suicides in the community:
> 
> Most people in Russia are biased towards the LGBTQ+ community, reluctant to understand the pains and struggles of the community. In the case of transgender people, this bias directly affects the speed of a person's social adaptation. Despite the fact that the situation in Europe is generally better, one can often face people who reject them.
> 
> The Netherlands is a country known for its tolerance and attention to the problems of the LGBTQ+ community, as well as for its respect for the idea of psychological support for everyone who feels the need for it. However, LGBTQ+ people living in this country evidently face certain problems. According to Wouter Kikens, doctoral researcher at the University of Groningen: “The number of reported cases of discrimination and violence against LGBTQ+ people has increased from 428 in year 2009 to 2471 in 2021. […] Seven out of ten LGBTQ+ people are subjected to discriminatory violence, both verbal and physical.” Kikens believes that although in general the Netherlands is a fairly tolerant country, it has a lot to learn from other cultures in respect to its attitude to the LGBTQ+ community. For example, berdashi or people with two souls have long lived in the Indigenous peoples of North America, identified as people of the “third sex” and they were fully accepted in the community.

> What can possibly be done to prevent tragedies like Khina's suicide from happening?
> 
> First of all, it is necessary that a person going through a difficult period in life should be able to find timely help, at least remotely. In particular, for English/Dutch speakers in the Netherlands, there is a telephone hotline for psychological support for suicide prevention: 0800-0113 (English/Dutch). There is also a local Support Service telephone line (0800-0333), which employs multilingual specialists, including Russian-speaking ones. They also have an application.
> 
> Further, the help services need volunteers who can support those who do not speak the language of the given country, as well as help to find the right medical specialist. Some of the volunteers must be ready to accompany new arrivals to a doctor's appointment as an interpreter.
> 
> Finally, the direct participation of the state authorities of the hosting country is equally important. Medical hormone therapy is vital for transgender people, and psychological assistance can be attributed to basic needs in this case, along with food and other basic necessities.
> 
> The number one cause of suicide is untreated depression. Depression is treatable, and suicide is preventable. You can get help from confidential support lines for the suicidal and those in emotional crisis. Visit Befrienders.org to find a suicide prevention helpline in your country. 




> Transgender girl Khina Zakharova committed suicide while in a refugee camp in the Netherlands
> 
> Zakharova, 21, applied for asylum as a transgender woman in December 2022. She flew to the Netherlands from Serbia. In Belgrade, KLM refused to let her on board, despite all the necessary paperwork. Lawyers intervened. Zakharova arrived in the Netherlands, passed an interview and was in the Drachter open camp. Several meetings were held with the immigration lawyer.
> 
> The deadlines for the consideration of such cases in the Netherlands are now extended. They last for years.
> 
> Zakharova complained about problems getting hormone replacement therapy. It is alleged that she had to interrupt therapy. According to other sources, the refugee camp staff found a way to provide Zakharova with access to therapy, but she was experiencing severe depression.




> When there is not enough protection, where are you?
> 
> Monday evening February 27, 9.30 pm I received a report from a resident of one of the lhbtiq+ units in azc Drachten. Just before that, Khina had been found in the bathroom of her unit in her azc where she had committed suicide. For LGBT Asylum Support, this is a second trans asylum seeker who died by suicide in an azc within a month and a half.
> 
> Khina applied for asylum in the Netherlands as a trans woman in December 2022. During her flight to the Netherlands, a month before, she contacted her after KLM refused to let her board in Belgrade despite all the necessary papers. Nevertheless, a month later she managed to apply for asylum in the Netherlands and thus for protection. She announced herself with a cheerful message, characteristic of how she was: 'Hello, I'm in open camp Drachter, NL. Registration interview complete. I was in closed camp Schiphol. Meeting with my lawyer be in this Friday. It's Khina Zakharova.'
> 
> I then saw her in her azc, just as cheerful: 'Today is my second day in open camp. Meeting new people) People here is very good. It was an interesting experience.' But there were many problems under the skin. Not only the waiting times of the IND, which went from 6 to 15 months, but also that she begged in vain for help from agencies such as obtaining hormones and did not receive it. 'I've been at camp for a month now, but the GZA still hasn't given me a prescription for hormones. 
> 
> This worries me very much, since I only take hormones that I brought from Russia, but their quality is unknown to me.' But also mental help: 'I spoke with a psychotherapist from GZA. He said that he needed time to contact the hospital in Groningen. They have a team that deals with transgender people.
> 
> That mental help did not come, despite all her pleas to the GZA, but also to the national suicide prevention hotline 0800 113 to which we always refer. 'This whole situation with the expectation of a solution to my question puts a lot of pressure on me psychologically.' Because providing protection also means access to medical care.
> 
> Early this morning I got white roses and made her a message with a mourning photo for the more than 700 lhbtiq + asylum seekers that we assist as best as possible. A group, like Khina, who not only wait endlessly but are also in need, unable to process their traumas in overcrowded AZCs. A mourning photo with a much too young woman, 21 years old, who looks at you with a guitar. Who sent me hearts on my messages to finally belong to a family that understands and accepts her unconditionally. Numb with grief, today we called her best friend in her azc in Russian with her divorced parents in Russia, discussed Dela's checklist together with the COA. I spoke to Russian-speaking friends in her asylum seekers centre, her new friends, her new, proud LGBTIQ+ family. Then, with all the LGBTIQ+ residents at her unit, to commemorate her for a minute, or maybe it was longer. Wherever she is now.

> Rest in peace Kina.
