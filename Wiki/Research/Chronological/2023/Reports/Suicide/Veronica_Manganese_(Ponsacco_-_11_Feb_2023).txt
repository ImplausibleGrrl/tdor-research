> The body of a woman was found in the river: the police are investigating
> In the late afternoon of Saturday 11 February, a team of firefighters found the body of a woman , apparently of a young age, at the point where the Era river flows into the Arno, in the Ponsacco area. The operators were on site to search for Veronica Manganese , a 23-year-old who disappeared right from the city of furniture on Tuesday 7 February.
> 
> The police immediately intervened on the spot, who also acquired the clothes that presumably belonged to the woman, found on the embankment a few meters from the point where the firefighters discovered the body. The coroner will establish the cause of death while the investigations are in full swing. Unfortunately, there are no more doubts about the identity of the body. In fact, Veronica's family communicated that the body is that of the 23-year-old.





> Body of a woman found in Ponsacco 11 February 2023 16:07ChroniclePonsacco According to the investigators, it would be a 23-year-old who was reported missing A team of firefighters, while participating in the search for a young woman who disappeared in recent days from Ponsacco, in the Pisano area, today found the body of a woman at the confluence of the Era torrent and the Arno river. The body was devoid of clothes, found not far from the place of the macabre discovery. According to the investigators, the clothes belong to the missing girl: a 23-year-old whose absence was reported last Tuesday by her family. No obvious signs of wounds were seen on her body, which would suggest the police of Pontedera, in charge of the investigation, that the girl may have decided to undress and immerse herself in the waters of the stream to take her life.
