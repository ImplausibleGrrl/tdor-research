> On January 4th, my sweet sister, Gwen, passed away at the age of 22.
>
> Words cannot begin to express my grief and pain as we process this devastating loss in our family. A piece of me will forever be missing as I try to understand why this had to happen, why she had to go, why we couldn’t save her. Gwen was the strongest person I knew who took on every hurdle in life with grace and perseverance.
> 
> Diagnosed with a debilitating chronic disease at 14, Gwen went through more in her teen years than what many go through in a lifetime. Constant surgeries, months-long stays in the hospital, having a damn colostomy bag as a freshman in high school. I never could’ve survived what she went through, and certainly not with the positive attitude that she always had. Coming out as a trans woman at 19 brought on a new set of challenges Gwen had to navigate while the world continued to work against her. What never changed was her endearing personality and welcoming heart. There was nobody else more brave, witty, compassionate, and strong. She was a light in every life she touched.
> 
> I am at a loss of how to continue on knowing she’s gone from our world. Gwen was my only full sibling — we were like two peas in a pod growing up. Our family is forever broken without her. The immense grief we feel not understanding why this happened is overwhelming. So many unanswered questions and what-if’s. So many regrets and wishes to turn back time to try to make it all better for her. I feel like I’m at the bottom of a 100-feet hole and I’ll never be able to get back out. I love you so much Gwen, and I am so sorry.
