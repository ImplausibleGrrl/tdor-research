> As I take my final breaths and exit this living earth, I would like to apologize to everyone I let down. I am so sorry I could not be better. To those that I love, I am sorry I could not be stronger. To those that gave me their everything, I am sorry my effort was not reciprocated. Please understand that me leaving is not a reflection on you, but the result of my own inability to turn myself for the better. To Ashley, Cynthia, Regine & Sophia. I am so sorry. Please remember me for the good memories we have shared, and never for my downfall. I will see you all again on the other side. Brianna, I’m coming.

Many of us, just like myself, who couldn’t sleep, jumped on it right away. All night I tried to reach out, called , texted, messaged her family on fb, as so did others. Finally someone was able to send the police for a wellness check, unfortunately it was too late.  Words can’t describe the sadness I’m feeling. Kayleigh, I’m sorry I wasn’t fast enough, sorry within the 7 mins of you posting your status it was just too late.

> Maybe it was destiny for me to be awake during your last few moments, but know that I’m broken, shattered, that someone as beautiful as you, would do this to yourself. I know life as a trans hasn’t been easy for you, you struggled but came so far along that we believed nothing would stop you. This world, mainly COUNTRY did you wrong, and I truly hope there’s justice and change for you. I hope you are at peace now and please keep looking after us. We love you. Rest in peace queen.”
> 
> I’ve been following Kayleigh on social media since she made her transition and the news hits me hard. I could see that Scott was crying out in pain in social media posts over the last few months. She became disgruntled about her job and discouraged over other aspects of her personal life.
> 
> My heart breaks for her. I never met Kayleigh. I never had the chance to fly with her. And yet even as one of her thousands of social media followers from a distance, I feel responsible for not doing more. I saw pain and did not reach out. We cannot possibly save the world, but we can minister to those around us in need. I wish I had done more.
> 
> Whoever you are, wherever you are, there are better alternatives to suicide. This irreversible step is not the right path. I pray for peace and comfort for all who knew and loved Kayleigh.

> I’ll be honest, I’ve been wearing my red AFA pin for months. But this solidifies my decision to do so. The expectations of the company and communication from Senior Leadership only validate accusations that this airline doesn’t actually care about the quality of living for its employees It’s time to solidify change and build a solid foundation for the future of United Flight Attendants.”

> Let’s put this in another perspective. 
> In 2022 I physically worked 344 flights (deadheads removed). Calculated out to 316 hours of boarding & deplaning (average 40 minutes for boarding and 15 for deplaning). Thats 316 hours of unpaid labor in 2022. At last years pay rate, that’s $11,000 lost. 
> Let’s start paying Flight Attendants for boarding in 2023. Let’s advocate for change.

> We have also been receiving a lot of 3-4 hour sit times between flights built into our pairings, which are also unpaid. Your flight attendants are not paid for much of the day they spend at work

> 2022 has been a year packed with upset and difficulty. I saw too much death & loss in my life, I came to realize I work a meaningless job for a company that doesn’t value me as an employee, I had my heart destroyed, I lost my nice little home and had to downsize significantly and start over. I’m really struggling to find happiness and hope. I’m begging 2023 to be better to me. Please.
