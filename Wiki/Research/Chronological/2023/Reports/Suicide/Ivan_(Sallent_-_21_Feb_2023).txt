> What does the story of "the Argentine twins in Barcelona" leave us?
> "Iván's suicide leaves a message to those of us who survived and alerts society to the danger of transphobia and xenophobia. It is inevitable that his death will be read in a political key," says the author of this article, which covers the tensions and the media treatment that has been given in recent weeks to the story that we know as "the death of the Argentine twins in Barcelona."
> March 10, 2023 - 01:21
> 
> It is difficult to determine exactly what is the correct way to treat the death of Iván, the trans boy who threw himself from a balcony in Barcelona together with his twin sister, from the media. It is necessary to delve into the problems, try to put yourself in the place from which the different positions are enunciated (even when we find them unpleasant) and look at the events as part of a developing process. 
> 
> Hundreds of thousands of kilometers from the place where Iván's unfortunate death occurred and without being able to bridge the political and cultural distances we have with the Catalan people, all our approximations will be inaccurate . This will also be a vain attempt to understand the intimate tensions and political disputes that are put into conflict around the identity of trans people , especially when they are not present to defend themselves.
> 
> The first news about Iván's death did not show his transition process . We simply knew the case as the death of the Argentine "twins" in Barcelona as a result of bullying received within the school environment. Little by little, we learned the details and dismantled that first conglomerate of "the twins" to realize that each one of the siblings experienced bullying differently. We found out that both were harassed for being Argentine and for not being fluent in Catalan. 
> 
> The appearance of the letters left by Iván and his sister helped us to know that even the decision to commit suicide had nuances: Iván openly declared his weariness for the violence received and for the lack of horizons for his life, while Leila simply expressed that she wanted to accompany his sister (sic), even to the end. 
> 
> In that letter Iván used feminine pronouns to refer to himself and so did his sister when mentioning him, however, over time he sweated that he had told his intimate circle of friends that he "felt like a boy" and wanted to be called Iván . In fact, it was learned that his schoolmates bothered him by calling him "Ivana" and calling him a "tomboy". Thus, we learned that the bullying was not only due to his migrant status , but also to his trans identity.
> 
> At first, the parents and relatives spoke publicly about Iván's identity. It was known that during the burial his mother mentioned the chosen name of his son de él, and also his grandparents de él mentioned that he had cut his hair very short and stated that he wanted to be called Iván. 
> 
> However, last week the parents issued a statement where they made it clear that they did not want the death of their daughter (sic) to become a media circus , nor used for political purposes. The closure of said statement stated in forceful capital letters that "his name de él was not Iván, his name de él was Aldana" . Although this decision by the family to set Ivan's gender differently from the one established by him may seem shocking to us, it is not a singular fact. 
> 
> In other similar cases , such as those of Santiago Cancinos and Tehuel de la Torre , the family's first reaction is to deny the self-perceived identity of their children, perhaps without bad intentions, but shocked by the news at such a sensitive moment . In the Cancinos case, as with Iván, gender identity became known little by little and through the voices of friends. And it is that many times the first transition of trans people is with their friends and peers , rather than with their parents, due to the fear of being judged, kicked out of the home or punished. 
> 
> The parents of Santiago Cancinos had to slowly go through their own transition and assume that in the search for their son, a fundamental step was to recognize him as he felt. It is presumable that also for Iván's family, perhaps, this tragic moment is not the most opportunity to process the news about his gender identity From him.
> 
> These challenges have also been transferred to the media, which opted for different ways of dealing with the case. Some still persist in talking about Sallent's “twins”, mentioning Iván's gender identity almost as a footnote. Others highlight the issue, but do not move it in depth in the approach to his notes from him. In certain cases they use the “Alana/Iván” formula as an easy alternative to settle the debate. The most progressive and pro-LGBT media chose to call Iván by his chosen name de él, even in the face of the refusal of his relatives de él. 
> 
> And it is that as it was expressed in his recent statement, the death of Iván is an object of political tensions disputed on one side and the other of the crack, despite whoever weighs it. Iván's suicide leaves a message to those of us who survived and alerts society to the danger of transphobia and xenophobia. It is inevitable that his death of him be read in a political key and in fact, it is up to those of us who work in the media to report from that key, daring to politicize our practices. 
> 
> It is impossible to determine the “correct” way to report Iván's death and his gender identity, due to the gaps in the account and the elusiveness of his existence; but we can determine a way according to our political principles to talk about the subject. It is absurd to hide in the claim of truth about Iván's identity, when all identity is mutable and social.
> 
> However, the fact that communicating respectfully about Iván's death represents a complex challenge for the media and that political tensions and sensitive expressions of family members must be overcome, it is always possible to refer to legal frameworks current and trans voices . 
> 
> Both in Spain, after the recent enactment of the Trans Law, and in Argentina with Law 26,743; the gender identity of a person must be respected even without the registration change being made at the simple verbal request of the person. There are also hundreds of trans organizations that, from different perspectives, can contribute to respectful and assertive communication on the subject. 
> 
> The fact that there are no correct ways does not prevent us from always finding better ways to give those discussions that will make a difference to guarantee the freedoms of our childhoods to come.




> Trans childhoods, bullying and preventable deaths
> Leila and Iván climbed on two chairs on a balcony and jumped into the void from a third floor: they were being bullied. Experts in trans childhoods reflect on how to protect children.
> 
> The news occurs in Spain and says that two 12-year-old Argentine twins, Leila and Iván, climbed on two chairs on a balcony and jumped into the void from a third floor in Sallent (Barcelona). They left letters by way of farewell, where they wrote that they suffered bullying for their Argentine accent-they had been living there for two years-and that Iván was teased at school because of his transgender identity. Leila, who survived and is in very serious condition, wrote on that piece of paper that she was doing it in solidarity with her brother. These days, although the school has denied that they suffered bullying, colleagues and acquaintances, in addition to his Argentine grandfather , made journalistic statements that strengthen these hypotheses.
> 
> While the facts and circumstances are being investigated, the media report the news without respecting Iván's gender identity, treating him as feminine and mentioning his previous name . Some, appealing to a vener of journalistic solidity that is not such, have inserted among their notes https://elpais.com/espana/catalunya/2023-02-23/una-de-las-gemelas-de-sallent-que -asked-to-be-treated-as-a-boy-he-felt-misunderstood-with-his-transsexuality.html a disclaimer that states: "there is only evidence of the desire of the minor , aged 12, to be treated as a male through indirect sources.Neither her family nor her closest environment have spoken at the moment”.
> 
> From Presentes we consulted four specialized sources on the subject to contribute to how to better communicate some dimensions of this news that causes us deep sadness in a medium where we cover the violence suffered by LGBT+ people on a daily basis and especially transvestite and trans people.
> 
> Gabriela Mansilla is the mother of Luana , the first trans girl to have access to a document that respects her gender identity. She is also a militant for transvestite childhoods and adolescents and president of the Free Childhood Civil Association (ACIL). She wrote two books: Me baby, me princess and Free Butterflies.
> 
> Moved by the news and because she also has twin children, Gabriela says: “Protecting children is an obligation throughout the world. It has to do with informing, with beginning to educate those other children who punish and bully our children. If Iván went to a school where he received ridicule and violence, children must be educated, not only in Spain, but in the world. You have to understand that the person who has a vulva can build multiple identities. The one with a penis too."
> 
> For her, more information is needed so that families can hug their children and so that the media can transmit the news with the appropriate approach. “We need an urgent awareness to look at childhood but also at us as a society, with these bodies that make us uncomfortable. Let's be clear: these are preventable deaths. This is a social transhomicide,” she says.
> 
> The Free Childhood Association carried out the first statistical survey on the experiences of trans/transvestite childhoods and adolescents, and published the results in 2021. Of 200 families, 53% of those under 12 years of age and 63% of 12 and 17-year-olds said they had ideas of death. “The accumulation of demands, the label at birth, the exclusion, throw our children to a 40% suicide rate in Argentina. That is not being seen. There are no prevention policies. When the damage is to the body, emotionally, psychologically, children are suffering and resisting mistreatment at school, from classmates and teachers who have no information”, says Gabriela. And she says that with Luana they are evaluating whether or not she starts classes for this reason.
> 
> Manu Mireles is an activist, academic secretary of the Mocha Celis high school, identifies as a migrant and non-binary. “When we talk about moving away from the adult-centrist place, we are talking about listening to trans childhoods and adolescents. Open the door to prevent the violence they suffer daily. Working on the reparation is literally saving them and thinking about a world where we can all live”.
> 
> Manu believes that the educational system, families and communities “must take charge of understanding that there are a large number of gender identities and sexual orientations. Diversity in its widest spectrum. It is more than necessary that we assume the responsibility and the active role of training and informing ourselves in order to demand from   the media that there be a perspective of gender and sexual diversity in the news. And advance in the guarantee of all rights for transvestite , trans and non-binary children and adolescents”. 
> 
> Ese Montenegro, trans masculine activist, teacher trainer at ESI and adviser to the National Chamber of Deputies, invites us to think about this news from an intersectional and situated perspective. “The first thing that is read, part of a very installed and empowered narrative, is that trans people commit suicide. The focus is once again on the trans person and not on the situation that produces the structural conditions for someone to make a decision of these characteristics, which is never unique. There are multiple factors that generate states of generally mental illness ”, he warns.
> 
> That one says that it is enough to open the local or Spanish newspapers to realize it. Iván presents the identity with which he wants to be called, cuts his hair, tells a few people that his identity is trans . "I don't think so much proximity between this fact and the enactment of the trans law in Spain is coincidental ," he says, in a context of transodying speeches, excluding speeches and trans that had weight in the Spanish narrative.
> 
> “When a law like this is approved, this implies a cost for the people. It is an advance in rights but it is not free. In later or near times, there is a cost of symbolic violence that the people who defend it receive in communication or social terms that achievement. And we are not talking about this cost, it produces bullying and wear and tear on people's lives, ”says Ese. And he gives as an example the homo-hating narrative that was unleashed in Argentina in the pre-approval debate on Equal Marriage. Or the travesty narrative when the Law of Quota and Labor Inclusion Travesti Trans Lohana Berkins Diana Sacayán was sanctioned.
> 
> “All the media have denied Iván's right to identity. He has been named feminine countless times. They say that they are not aware that he has expressed his identity. The dead person is being sued to account for his struggle for his identity. The proposition is violent and absurd. If we are talking about the fact that he was able to communicate it to some people, that they mis-gendered him at school… Why do they continue to treat him as feminine? ”, he wonders.
> 
> Ese Montenegro adds other analysis variables: “we have to talk about xenophobia and how being a migrant and being trans intersect. The media pick up on the hypothesis that the twins were being charged for their Argentine accent. Oppressions do not add up, they are tied together and generate very specific violence”.
> 
> Reading articles in various Spanish media, he says, which often indicate that the family was under the orbit of social aid from state agencies, there is also a class issue. “It is noted 
> 
> that the family was in that structure because it was from a lower class, questioning whether the father worked or not in some notes. I wonder what imaginaries it enables and how it impacts the lives of two 12-year-olds who face a lot of inequalities. These narratives are enabled in the media that are a mirror of that hated. It is enough to read the notes to understand that we are not dangerous people, we are in danger. And that the situation we are facing is intersectional.”





> Alana's best friend, the twin who committed suicide in Sallent: "She was beaten and the teachers blamed her"
> Alana's best friend has recounted that on one occasion she was punched. For now, it is unknown why this bullying protocol was not activated.
> 
> The testimony of Alana's best friend, the young woman from Sallent: "The teachers blamed her"
> 
> Published: February 26, 2023, 7:40 pm
> "One day she told me that they pushed her and even punched her. What they did the most was insult her and push her. Hits only once or twice." Alana's best friend recounts the hell that the minor suffered for months. This Sunday a massive farewell was held in Sallent , Barcelona. The Mossos d'Esquadra continue the investigations, although from their closest environment they insist that the girl suffered bullying. The minor has assured that before cutting her hair they bullied her because of her Argentine accent, then she went because she felt like a man .
> 
> This young woman has also assured that the teachers came to throw her out of school between two and three times to avoid bullying, but no protocol was applied. "The teachers only separated them and blamed her," she pointed out. She has also explained that many days she left class crying and that they even hit her on occasion.
> 
> Main hypotheses
> 
> The judge responsible for the case already has the report from the Mossos d'Esquadra, according to which the minor's suicide could be due to multiple causes, including bullying and gender identity problems. The researchers, according to the sources, work with the hypothesis that there could be a host of circumstances that led them to this extreme situation , among them that they suffered bullying or problems related to the gender identity of the deceased, who had asked her surroundings to call her Ivan.
> 
> The Ministry of Education of the Generalitat, which at first ruled out bullying as a cause of suicide, reversed course on Thursday and acknowledged that all the hypotheses are still open, for which reason it has activated the technicians of the Support Unit for Students in a situation of violence (USAV) ​​to address this case. For now, it is unknown why the protocol was not activated , so the Department of Education has launched an investigation.
> 
> The two minors rushed from the balcony of a third floor of their home in Sallent , and one of them died while the other is admitted in serious condition at the Pac Taulí hospital in Sabadell. According to the sources, everything points to the fact that it was the sister who called herself Iván who took the initiative to end her life by jumping off the balcony from a third floor, while her sister, who remains seriously injured in the hospital, jumped like show of solidarity.




> Grandparents of the twins who fell from a third floor say they suffered bullying
> General information February 23, 2023
> They pointed out that they were harassed at school because of their nationality, because of "their accent", a situation that "worsened" when one of them (Alana) "decided to cut her hair, wear male clothes and identify herself as Iván" .
> 
> The grandparents of the Argentine twins who fell from a third floor in Sallent, Barcelona, ​​after which one died and the other remained hospitalized in critical condition, assured that their granddaughters suffered from bullying.
> 
> The grandfather, named Lima, explained that his granddaughters suffered bullying at school because of their nationality because of "her accent", a situation that "worsened" when one of them (Alana) "two or three months ago decided to cut her hair, put on male clothing and identify himself as Ivan".
> 
> He also pointed out that neither his son nor his daughter-in-law were aware that the attacks against Iván had intensified due to the change in his gender identity, but that in a letter he left before jumping off the balcony, he explained that "he was not happy now and that never in his life would he be able to be happy for the decision he had made".
> 
> The man told Télam that he will travel to Barcelona in the next few hours thanks to a collection made by residents of Mar del Plata, the city where he resides, and the Argentine Foreign Ministry reported that it is collaborating and accompanying the family.
> 
> The girls' paternal grandfather, who works as a taxi driver, said that "the family is destroyed."
> 
> The Argentine Ministry of Foreign Relations reported that "the consulate in Barcelona and the Foreign Ministry, from the Directorate of Argentines Abroad, are collaborating with all the preparations and consular assistance for the trip of the girls' grandfather to Spain."
> 
> Lima asked "society" to reflect on these situations and explained that Iván "had not had a good time since he arrived and he wanted to come two months ago."
> 
> El Observatorio contra la Homofobia de Barcelona publicó en su cuenta de Twitter: "Una noticia que nos rompe el corazón, un niño trans de 12 años se suicida en Sallent. Una muerte marcada por la intolerancia, el bullying y la transfobia".
> 
> Por su parte, desde el Instituto Llobregat de Sallent, donde concurrían la niña e Iván, aseguraron que no constan expedientes por acoso escolar.
> 
> Sobre el estado de salud de la gemela que sobrevivió, la abuela dijo que se encuentra "sedada" en el Hospital Parc Taulí de Sabadell y agregó que tiene "varios huesos rotos" y que será intervenida quirúrgicamente en las próximas horas.




> Alana and Leila's letters reveal that they wanted to commit suicide due to possible harassment of one of them due to transphobia
> A Manresa court investigates this tragic event that has caused discomfort among the twins' environment towards the administration for denying the mockery they suffered
> 
> The first thing that surprised the investigators is that it was a collective suicide . "When someone takes their own life, they always do it individually, it is an intimate act, they are not accompanied," police sources explain. For this reason, the Mossos d'Esquadra in charge of investigating the death of Alana and Leila , aged 12 , are analyzing the entire lives of the minors to determine the causes, in the plural, that prompted them to jump from a third floor of the house in Sallent where they lived last Tuesday afternoon.
> 
> The Mossos found two handwritten letters from the twins in the family home as well as chairs on the balcony from which they jumped. The researchers analyze both these letters in which the minors would explain the reasons for their suicide, although it would presumably be related to the misunderstanding of the sexual identity of one of them, who wanted to be a man and be called Iván, and the unconditional support of his sister.
> 
> Manresa Investigating Court number 5, which was on duty, took charge of the investigation from the outset and ordered the removal of the body of the deceased minor. He is pending the police report and the medical reports to continue with the investigation, although everything points to a voluntary jump of the twins . The priority is to know the multiple factors that have ended in this tragic event .
> 
> The agents investigate the environment of the minors to determine what type of harassment they could suffer. In addition to asking friends and classmates, they also track their social networks. The environment of the sisters pointed out in various media that the minors were mocked for their Argentine origin. In addition, Alana , the one who died, also because of her decision to want to change her sex . In this sense, the messages that friends and family have left, along with candles and bouquets of flowers, on an improvised altar in front of the building where the minors resided leave no doubt.
> 
> "You have earned heaven, little one. Rest in Peace. Justice" or "I keep the good times, with that smile you always had on that beautiful face", were some of the memories of the deceased sister along with photos of the two twins with family and friends . Some of them explained that her decision to become a boy increased the teasing that had come from before for her Argentine accent.
> 
> Even the Observatori Contra l'Homofòbia went further and assured in a message on social networks: "News that breaks our hearts, a 12-year-old trans boy commits suicide in Sallent . A death marked by intolerance, bullying and transphobia. We send all the heat to Iván's environment and we make ourselves available in case psychosocial and legal support is requested".
> 
> One of the twins had been referred to the mental health services (CESMIJ), in addition to being cared for by a psychologist from the center and a counselor due to their family situation, since it was unstable due to the relationship between the parents, as well as social , since the family has another minor child. She was wondering if they suffered from some kind of disorder. While Alana died instantly, Leila is still admitted to the Parc Taulí hospital in Sabadell in serious condition due to numerous traumas and head injuries, although for the moment she does not fear for her life.
> 
> The family, of Argentine origin, has been living in the town for two years and the social services of the Sallent City Council have been monitoring them for a long time. In addition, the minors received help from psychologists at the Llobregat institute, to which they attended, as well as care outside the center.
> 
> At first, after the suicide , both the Department of Education of the Generalitat and the Sallent City Council or the institute itself ruled out possible harassment since no alarm had gone off in these psychological visits. to the two minors The City Council stressed that they had activated "all the resources available at the level of social, educational and psychological support to care for the minors and the family" and stressed that it is a "shocking and painful event for the whole of our population".
> 
> However, this Thursday the situation took a radical turn after receiving new information about this alleged harassment related to the will of the deceased to want to be a man and Education activated the Support Unit for Students in Situations of Violence (USAV) ​​to investigate the numerous factors, since in cases of suicide it is not explained by a single reason, which could lead the minors to want to take their own life. The investigation of this unit is parallel to that carried out by the Mossos d'Esquadra by court order and which is following the same path to find out the reasons for the sisters' decision. Alana and Leila did not want to separate even in the end, although now one must learn to survive without the other.
