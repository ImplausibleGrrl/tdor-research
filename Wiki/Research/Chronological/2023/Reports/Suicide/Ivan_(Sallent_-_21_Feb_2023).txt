> Trans childhoods, bullying and preventable deaths
> Leila and Iván climbed on two chairs on a balcony and jumped into the void from a third floor: they were being bullied. Experts in trans childhoods reflect on how to protect children.
> 
> The news occurs in Spain and says that two 12-year-old Argentine twins, Leila and Iván, climbed on two chairs on a balcony and jumped into the void from a third floor in Sallent (Barcelona). They left letters by way of farewell, where they wrote that they suffered bullying for their Argentine accent-they had been living there for two years-and that Iván was teased at school because of his transgender identity. Leila, who survived and is in very serious condition, wrote on that piece of paper that she was doing it in solidarity with her brother. These days, although the school has denied that they suffered bullying, colleagues and acquaintances, in addition to his Argentine grandfather , made journalistic statements that strengthen these hypotheses.
> 
> While the facts and circumstances are being investigated, the media report the news without respecting Iván's gender identity, treating him as feminine and mentioning his previous name . Some, appealing to a vener of journalistic solidity that is not such, have inserted among their notes https://elpais.com/espana/catalunya/2023-02-23/una-de-las-gemelas-de-sallent-que -asked-to-be-treated-as-a-boy-he-felt-misunderstood-with-his-transsexuality.html a disclaimer that states: "there is only evidence of the desire of the minor , aged 12, to be treated as a male through indirect sources.Neither her family nor her closest environment have spoken at the moment”.
> 
> From Presentes we consulted four specialized sources on the subject to contribute to how to better communicate some dimensions of this news that causes us deep sadness in a medium where we cover the violence suffered by LGBT+ people on a daily basis and especially transvestite and trans people.
> 
> Gabriela Mansilla is the mother of Luana , the first trans girl to have access to a document that respects her gender identity. She is also a militant for transvestite childhoods and adolescents and president of the Free Childhood Civil Association (ACIL). She wrote two books: Me baby, me princess and Free Butterflies.
> 
> Moved by the news and because she also has twin children, Gabriela says: “Protecting children is an obligation throughout the world. It has to do with informing, with beginning to educate those other children who punish and bully our children. If Iván went to a school where he received ridicule and violence, children must be educated, not only in Spain, but in the world. You have to understand that the person who has a vulva can build multiple identities. The one with a penis too."
> 
> For her, more information is needed so that families can hug their children and so that the media can transmit the news with the appropriate approach. “We need an urgent awareness to look at childhood but also at us as a society, with these bodies that make us uncomfortable. Let's be clear: these are preventable deaths. This is a social transhomicide,” she says.
> 
> The Free Childhood Association carried out the first statistical survey on the experiences of trans/transvestite childhoods and adolescents, and published the results in 2021. Of 200 families, 53% of those under 12 years of age and 63% of 12 and 17-year-olds said they had ideas of death. “The accumulation of demands, the label at birth, the exclusion, throw our children to a 40% suicide rate in Argentina. That is not being seen. There are no prevention policies. When the damage is to the body, emotionally, psychologically, children are suffering and resisting mistreatment at school, from classmates and teachers who have no information”, says Gabriela. And she says that with Luana they are evaluating whether or not she starts classes for this reason.
> 
> Manu Mireles is an activist, academic secretary of the Mocha Celis high school, identifies as a migrant and non-binary. “When we talk about moving away from the adult-centrist place, we are talking about listening to trans childhoods and adolescents. Open the door to prevent the violence they suffer daily. Working on the reparation is literally saving them and thinking about a world where we can all live”.
> 
> Manu believes that the educational system, families and communities “must take charge of understanding that there are a large number of gender identities and sexual orientations. Diversity in its widest spectrum. It is more than necessary that we assume the responsibility and the active role of training and informing ourselves in order to demand from   the media that there be a perspective of gender and sexual diversity in the news. And advance in the guarantee of all rights for transvestite , trans and non-binary children and adolescents”. 
> 
> Ese Montenegro, trans masculine activist, teacher trainer at ESI and adviser to the National Chamber of Deputies, invites us to think about this news from an intersectional and situated perspective. “The first thing that is read, part of a very installed and empowered narrative, is that trans people commit suicide. The focus is once again on the trans person and not on the situation that produces the structural conditions for someone to make a decision of these characteristics, which is never unique. There are multiple factors that generate states of generally mental illness ”, he warns.
> 
> That one says that it is enough to open the local or Spanish newspapers to realize it. Iván presents the identity with which he wants to be called, cuts his hair, tells a few people that his identity is trans . "I don't think so much proximity between this fact and the enactment of the trans law in Spain is coincidental ," he says, in a context of transodying speeches, excluding speeches and trans that had weight in the Spanish narrative.
> 
> “When a law like this is approved, this implies a cost for the people. It is an advance in rights but it is not free. In later or near times, there is a cost of symbolic violence that the people who defend it receive in communication or social terms that achievement. And we are not talking about this cost, it produces bullying and wear and tear on people's lives, ”says Ese. And he gives as an example the homo-hating narrative that was unleashed in Argentina in the pre-approval debate on Equal Marriage. Or the travesty narrative when the Law of Quota and Labor Inclusion Travesti Trans Lohana Berkins Diana Sacayán was sanctioned.
> 
> “All the media have denied Iván's right to identity. He has been named feminine countless times. They say that they are not aware that he has expressed his identity. The dead person is being sued to account for his struggle for his identity. The proposition is violent and absurd. If we are talking about the fact that he was able to communicate it to some people, that they mis-gendered him at school… Why do they continue to treat him as feminine? ”, he wonders.
> 
> Ese Montenegro adds other analysis variables: “we have to talk about xenophobia and how being a migrant and being trans intersect. The media pick up on the hypothesis that the twins were being charged for their Argentine accent. Oppressions do not add up, they are tied together and generate very specific violence”.
> 
> Reading articles in various Spanish media, he says, which often indicate that the family was under the orbit of social aid from state agencies, there is also a class issue. “It is noted 
> 
> that the family was in that structure because it was from a lower class, questioning whether the father worked or not in some notes. I wonder what imaginaries it enables and how it impacts the lives of two 12-year-olds who face a lot of inequalities. These narratives are enabled in the media that are a mirror of that hated. It is enough to read the notes to understand that we are not dangerous people, we are in danger. And that the situation we are facing is intersectional.”



> Grandparents of the twins who fell from a third floor say they suffered bullying
> General information February 23, 2023

> 
> The grandparents of the Argentine twins who fell from a third floor in Sallent, Barcelona, ​​after which one died and the other remained hospitalized in critical condition, assured that their granddaughters suffered from bullying.
> 
> The grandfather, named Lima, explained that his granddaughters suffered bullying at school because of their nationality because of "her accent", a situation that "worsened" when one of them (Alana) "two or three months ago decided to cut her hair, put on male clothing and identify himself as Ivan".
> 
> He also pointed out that neither his son nor his daughter-in-law were aware that the attacks against Iván had intensified due to the change in his gender identity, but that in a letter he left before jumping off the balcony, he explained that "he was not happy now and that never in his life would he be able to be happy for the decision he had made".
> 
> The man told Télam that he will travel to Barcelona in the next few hours thanks to a collection made by residents of Mar del Plata, the city where he resides, and the Argentine Foreign Ministry reported that it is collaborating and accompanying the family.
> 
> The girls' paternal grandfather, who works as a taxi driver, said that "the family is destroyed."
>

> Alana and Leila's letters reveal that they wanted to commit suicide due to possible harassment of one of them due to transphobia
> A Manresa court investigates this tragic event that has caused discomfort among the twins' environment towards the administration for denying the mockery they suffered
> 
> The first thing that surprised the investigators is that it was a collective suicide . "When someone takes their own life, they always do it individually, it is an intimate act, they are not accompanied," police sources explain. For this reason, the Mossos d'Esquadra in charge of investigating the death of Alana and Leila , aged 12 , are analyzing the entire lives of the minors to determine the causes, in the plural, that prompted them to jump from a third floor of the house in Sallent where they lived last Tuesday afternoon.
> 
> The Mossos found two handwritten letters from the twins in the family home as well as chairs on the balcony from which they jumped. The researchers analyze both these letters in which the minors would explain the reasons for their suicide, although it would presumably be related to the misunderstanding of the sexual identity of one of them, who wanted to be a man and be called Iván, and the unconditional support of his sister.
> 
> Manresa Investigating Court number 5, which was on duty, took charge of the investigation from the outset and ordered the removal of the body of the deceased minor. He is pending the police report and the medical reports to continue with the investigation, although everything points to a voluntary jump of the twins . The priority is to know the multiple factors that have ended in this tragic event .
> 
> The agents investigate the environment of the minors to determine what type of harassment they could suffer. In addition to asking friends and classmates, they also track their social networks. The environment of the sisters pointed out in various media that the minors were mocked for their Argentine origin. In addition, Alana , the one who died, also because of her decision to want to change her sex . In this sense, the messages that friends and family have left, along with candles and bouquets of flowers, on an improvised altar in front of the building where the minors resided leave no doubt.
> 
> "You have earned heaven, little one. Rest in Peace. Justice" or "I keep the good times, with that smile you always had on that beautiful face", were some of the memories of the deceased sister along with photos of the two twins with family and friends . Some of them explained that her decision to become a boy increased the teasing that had come from before for her Argentine accent.
> 
> Even the Observatori Contra l'Homofòbia went further and assured in a message on social networks: "News that breaks our hearts, a 12-year-old trans boy commits suicide in Sallent . A death marked by intolerance, bullying and transphobia. We send all the heat to Iván's environment and we make ourselves available in case psychosocial and legal support is requested".
> 
> One of the twins had been referred to the mental health services (CESMIJ), in addition to being cared for by a psychologist from the center and a counselor due to their family situation, since it was unstable due to the relationship between the parents, as well as social , since the family has another minor child. She was wondering if they suffered from some kind of disorder. While Alana died instantly, Leila is still admitted to the Parc Taulí hospital in Sabadell in serious condition due to numerous traumas and head injuries, although for the moment she does not fear for her life.
> 
> The family, of Argentine origin, has been living in the town for two years and the social services of the Sallent City Council have been monitoring them for a long time. In addition, the minors received help from psychologists at the Llobregat institute, to which they attended, as well as care outside the center.
> 
> At first, after the suicide , both the Department of Education of the Generalitat and the Sallent City Council or the institute itself ruled out possible harassment since no alarm had gone off in these psychological visits. to the two minors The City Council stressed that they had activated "all the resources available at the level of social, educational and psychological support to care for the minors and the family" and stressed that it is a "shocking and painful event for the whole of our population".
> 
> However, this Thursday the situation took a radical turn after receiving new information about this alleged harassment related to the will of the deceased to want to be a man and Education activated the Support Unit for Students in Situations of Violence (USAV) ​​to investigate the numerous factors, since in cases of suicide it is not explained by a single reason, which could lead the minors to want to take their own life. The investigation of this unit is parallel to that carried out by the Mossos d'Esquadra by court order and which is following the same path to find out the reasons for the sisters' decision. Alana and Leila did not want to separate even in the end, although now one must learn to survive without the other.
