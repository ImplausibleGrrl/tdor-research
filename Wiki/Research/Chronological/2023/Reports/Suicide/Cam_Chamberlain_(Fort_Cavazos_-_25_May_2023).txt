> Questions Swirl After Missing Texas Soldier Found Alive But Estranged Wife Found Dead
> Officials have not revealed the details of how Cam Chamberlain died and how her estranged husband Craig Cameron was found
> Published 07/14/23 07:36 PM ET|Updated 8 hr ago
> 
> On May 15, the U.S. Army's Fort Cavazos asked the public’s help to locate Spc. Craig Chamberlain who was reported missing from his home in Killeen, Texas.
> 
> His estranged wife Cam Chamberlain was concerned about his mental health and safety — even telling a friend in a Facebook message, "Even though I’m getting divorced I still can’t help but think he’s in danger,” she wrote, according to NBC News. “I still love him and I’d blame myself if anything happened to him.”
> 
> But in a strange twist of events, it was Cam who wound up dead. 
> 
> “The III Armored Corps is deeply saddened to hear of the death of Cameron Chamberlain, the spouse of Army Spc. Craig Chamberlain. Our deepest condolences go out to the family and friends of Cameron Chamberlain,” according to a statement released on May 26 by Fort Cavazos and obtained by the Killeen Daily Herald.
> 
> Officials have not revealed where or how Cam died. An attempt to confirm the details of her death at the Bell County Medical Examiner’s office was unsuccessful.
> 
> Hours after officials announced her passing, military officials released a statement that her husband Craig Chamberlain had been found.
> 
> “We are thankful that Specialist Chamberlain has been found,” said Lt. Col. Zachary Brainard, commander of the 2nd Chemical Battalion at Fort Cavazos. “We will continue to provide him with the care and assistance he needs.”
> 
> Officials did not reveal where or how he was found. Craig's mother Virginia Chamberlain told NBC News that her son was found in "rough shape." An attempt to reach them by phone was unsuccessful.
> 
> A Fort Cavazos spokesperson declined to tell NBC News his status in the Army because he was the subject of an administrative investigation. An attempt to reach officials were unsuccessful.
> 
> Late last year, Craig received orders that he would be relocated to South Korea. At the time, the couple moved into a friend’s house preparing for the move, NBC News reports.
> 
> But their rocky relationship grew more difficult and they separated in the new year.
> 
> It wasn’t until Craig’s disappearance that Cam learned that he wasn’t reporting for duty and declared AWOL.
> 
> "He told me he was going to work the whole time, so I didn’t think anything of it, but in reality, he wasn’t really going to work; he was just saying he was going to work,” Cam told the Killeen newspaper. 
> 
> Meanwhile, friends of Cam want answers surrounding her death. At the very least, they’d like the chance to say good-bye.
> 
> “I can’t even mourn her death the way family should, because it’s as if she never existed at all now,” longtime friend Shandy Eubank told NBC News.




> Fort Cavazos’s transgender wife Cam Chamberlain found dead
> BY Anas Shah Jul 14, 2023. 03:06 pm UPDATED: Jul 14, 2023. 03:06 pm
> 
> According to a story, an Army post in Texas is investigating the inexplicable murder of a soldier’s wife, whose body was discovered while the serviceman was short away.
> 
> Cam Chamberlain’s death in May aroused several suspicions, particularly because her husband, Army Specialist Craig Chamberlain, was discovered alive the next day after going missing for less than two weeks.
> 
> Cam, a transgender woman, reported her husband missing on May 15, with Army officials at Fort Cavazos assuming the 23-year-old was “willfully” away from his unit, according to KWTX.
> 
> Her death was declared on May 25, and he was discovered alive on May 26.
> 
> According to NBC News, Army investigators have begun a criminal inquiry, however a spokeswoman would not disclose any specifics.
> 
> It is not known when, where, or how she died.
> 
> No autopsy has been conducted, and no funeral has been scheduled, the outlet reported.
> 
> “I can’t even mourn her death the way family should, because it’s as if she never existed at all now,” her longtime friend Shandy Eubank told NBC News.
> 
> When Craig was found, he was in rough shape, his mother Virginia Chamberlain reportedly said.
> 
> Craig had also faced an administrative investigation into his disappearance, which has since concluded.
> 
> But the findings of the internal probe cannot be revealed due to privacy rules, NBC News reported.
> 
> Craig’s current status in the Army is unclear.
> 
> When he went missing, his wife reportedly told a friend she planned on breaking up with him, according to a friend.
> 
> “Even though I’m getting divorced I still can’t help but think he’s in danger,” she wrote, according to the outlet. “I still love him and I’d blame myself if anything happened to him.”
> 
> She also informed her buddy that when he disappeared, he left her without food or money for basics.
> 
> Cam shared a missing person notice on social media, indicating that he had departed without his keys or phone.
> 
> She also stated on the flier that he was going through a “bout of extreme depression.”
> 
> According to a May Killeen Daily Herald report, Craig’s wife stated she first found out about his abduction after he ceased reporting to the Army installation in March.
> 
> “He told me he was going to work the whole time, so I didn’t think anything of it, but in reality, he wasn’t really going to work; he was just saying he was going to work,” she reportedly said.
> 
> But Craig’s mother Virginia refuted that he was lying to Cam, citing photos from that time that showed he had long hair and facial hair, NBC News reported.
> 
> “You can’t report for duty like that in the Army,” she said.
> 
> Fort Cavazos stated Craig Chamberlain had “failed” to reach a new assignment for “unknown reason” and declined to comment on Cam Chamberlain’s assertions.




> A Texas soldier 'willfully' disappeared. Then his wife died — and he was found alive.
> The Army has launched a criminal investigation, but officials haven't said when or where she died. Her cause and manner of death haven't been disclosed, either.
> July 13, 2023, 2:00 PM BST
> 
> 
> In the days after her husband was reported missing to the Texas Army base where he was stationed, Cam Chamberlain sent a series of urgent Facebook messages to a longtime friend: When he disappeared, she said, he left her with no food and no money.
> 
> She wasn’t working, she was estranged from her family, and her efforts to get help from the Army had gone nowhere, two longtime friends said.  
> 
> “I’m scared,” she wrote to Jessica D’Lynn Pyles in a message the friend shared with NBC News. “I’m alone. I just want the pain to go away. I can’t take it anymore.”
> 
> Within a week of that message, Cam Chamberlain’s death was announced, and the next day, her husband — who had been missing for 11 days — was discovered alive. Spc. Craig Chamberlain, 23, had “willfully” disappeared from his unit, according to Army officials at his post, Fort Cavazos.
> 
> Military authorities have offered few answers about what happened, and friends of Cam Chamberlain, who was in her late 20s, have said they’ve found no solace in the aftermath of her death: There have been no autopsy, no obituary and no funeral. 
> 
> Officials confirmed her death in a statement May 25. The couple lived off base, and a spokeswoman for the Killeen Police Department referred questions about the case to Fort Cavazos authorities, who put out a statement confirming the death. They didn’t provide details about when or where she died, and her cause and manner of death haven’t been disclosed. 
> 
> Army investigators launched a criminal probe. A spokeswoman for the Army’s Criminal Investigation Division declined to comment further, citing an ongoing investigation.
> 
> “I can’t even mourn her death the way family should, because it’s as if she never existed at all now,” said Shandy Eubank, one of the longtime friends.
> 
> The day after authorities announced that his wife had died, Craig Chamberlain was found in “rough shape” in the Killeen area, said his mother, Virginia Chamberlain. In an interview with NBC News, she declined to say where her son is now.
> 
> A spokeswoman at Fort Cavazos declined to discuss his status in the Army, saying he was the subject of an administrative investigation in connection with his disappearance. The inquiry has been completed but can’t be disclosed because of privacy rules.
> 
> A quick marriage and an overseas assignment
> Craig and Cam Chamberlain met a few years ago through a dating app and were married in 2020, according to her Facebook page. Though Eubank believed the couple had rushed things, they initially seemed happy, she said.
> 
> “The way he treated her — he put her on a pedestal,” said Eubank, who met Cam when they worked together at an insurance company in Waco more than a decade ago. “He treated her better than anyone had treated her.”
> 
> She was a people person, Eubank said — someone who was as outspoken as she was happy and goofy.  
> 
> D’Lynn Pyles said, “You knew where she stood on things.”
> 
> In an interview with a Texas newspaper, Cam described her husband as laid back, patient and carefree. He has a unicorn tattooed on the upper part of his right arm, his mother said.
> 
> Craig Chamberlain was assigned to the 704th Explosive Ordnance Disposal Company at Fort Cavazos, formerly known as Fort Hood, one of the largest Army bases in the country, which sits roughly midway between Austin and Waco. 
> 
> A rift emerged between the couple over time, which Cam attributed partly to difficult family dynamics, Eubank said. Cam publicly identified as a transgender woman and had a rocky relationship with her own family, telling friends that her mother had “disowned” her, Eubank and D’Lynn Pyles recalled.
> 
> Efforts to reach Cam Chamberlain’s mother were unsuccessful. Messages left at a phone number listed as her brother’s weren’t returned.
> 
> Cam told Eubank that she struggled with her husband’s family, as well. Eubank remembered her friend recounting a conversation in which her mother-in-law challenged her ability to be in a loving relationship: “How can she know she loves Craig when she doesn’t know what gender she is?” 
> 
> Virginia Chamberlain called the comment “very, very inaccurate.”
> 
> “Did we have our differences? Absolutely,” she said. “But I will say I never bullied Cam. I never said a statement like that to Cam. Not once did that ever come out of my mouth.”
> 
> Craig Chamberlain’s father, Gordon Chamberlain, added that although he hadn’t met Cam before his son married her, “I said we’d treat Cam like anyone else that comes into our lives.”
> 
> The Army was sending Craig to South Korea, and Cam planned to “stick with him,” Eubank said, despite the growing tension between them. Fort Cavazos officials confirmed he had been ordered to South Korea in December for a long-term assignment. 
> 
> In a Jan. 8 Facebook post, Cam seemed excited about the trip — and traveling to other parts of Asia.
> 
> “Can’t wait for the FOOD,” she wrote in a post that D’Lynn Pyles captured in a screenshot and shared with NBC News. “I love real Asian food.”
> 
> But months passed, and the couple went nowhere. Then, on March 20, she posted that her husband’s orders had been deferred for six months — and that she learned so only the night before he was to have left.
> 
> “You never know what comes next,” she wrote in another post that D’Lynn Pyles shared. “Plans change faster than this Texas weather.”
> 
> A spokeswoman for Fort Cavazos declined to comment on the deferment, saying it was part of the base’s administrative investigation. 
> 
> By the time Cam Chamberlain reported her husband missing — he had last been seen May 15 — their relationship had become so “toxic” that she had planned to split up with him, she told D’Lynn Pyles in a Facebook message.
> 
> “Even though I’m getting divorced I still can’t help but think he’s in danger,” she wrote. “I still love him and I’d blame myself if anything happened to him.”
