> Brasenose College is mourning the sad death of Ezra Jackson, one of our 4th year undergraduates, who died suddenly on 26th May. Ezra had taken a break from study and was out of residence but living in South Oxford and in regular contact with friends at Brasenose.
> 
> The College has the deepest sympathy for Ezra’s family, and the Principal has been in touch with them and offered the College’s condolences and support. College students and staff have also been informed and offered counselling and support.
> 
> John Bowers, Principal of the College, said “Ezra was a very bright and popular member of our community, and their death will touch many of us deeply. Our thoughts are especially with Ezra’s family and friends and everyone at the college is doing all we can to help and support them and each other at such a difficult time.”
> 
> Lexi Loizou, the JCR President, said “Ezra was a dearly loved member of the Brasenose Junior Common Room and had a profound impact on the lives of many of us. Their tragic passing has deeply shocked us all, but the supportive community that BNC fosters has allowed us to all come together at this difficult time and grieve the loss of a dear friend to many. Our thoughts are especially with Ezra’s family and close friends during this time.”
