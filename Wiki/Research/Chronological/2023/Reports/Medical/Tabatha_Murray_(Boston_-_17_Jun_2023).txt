overdose



> The death of a transgender person that occurred in a South Boston apartment with four children present in June was caused by an accidental drug overdose, the medical examiner’s office said.
> 
> The cause of death was determined to be “acute intoxication due to the combined effects of cocaine and methamphetamine,” a spokesperson for the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner told the Herald on Monday.
> 
> The manner of death is listed as an accident.
> 
> A city death certificate identifies the victim as Giovanni Murray, a 26-year-old man described in a Boston Police Department report as a “male to female transgender” person.
> 
> The Suffolk District Attorney’s office is “conducting a standard death investigation” of what the medical examiner ruled to be a drug overdose, “as well as a fact-finding inquiry into other issues present in the incident,” a spokesperson for the DA Kevin Hayden told the Herald.
> 
> The spokesperson declined to say what those “other issues” pertain to.
> 
> The June 17 death at 381 Old Colony Ave., otherwise known as the Mary Ellen McCormack public housing complex, drew conflicting reports from the Boston Police and Fire Departments.
> 
> Both, however, filed 51A child abuse or neglect reports with the Department of Children and Families.
> 
> What was agreed upon was that the Boston Fire Department and EMS both responded first to a report of an unconscious person at the apartment.
> 
> The fire department reported at the time that the person had gone into cardiac arrest from an apparent drug overdose, a matter that police appeared to dispute in a statement it made days after the incident occurred.
> 
> “Information that drugs and other concerning materials were strewn about the home is not supported by what officers encountered or by the information received on scene,” the police department said at the time.
> 
> Mayor Michelle Wu made similar statements, debunking some of what was reported by the fire department — prompting an impassioned defense from the head of the fire union — several city councilors and the media, including the Herald.
> 
> City Councilor Michael Flaherty had said he was “informed by people at the scene that there were drugs, alcohol, sex toys all around the apartment as well as a dead body on the floor.”
> 
> He also stated that the dead body was from an “apparent overdose,” and a man “wearing a wig claiming to be the father of the kids” was found in the backroom.
> 
> Wu and City Councilor Kendra Lara were critical of these statements, saying that they were inflaming anti-transgender rhetoric and misgendering the people involved.
> 
> The fire department indicated the other adults present with the four children were transgender as well, saying in its report that, “approximately six adults, who appeared to be males” were in the apartment.
> 
> The department’s report also said the apartment was “in extreme unsanitary conditions,” and the adults present were uncooperative. Police refuted this, saying that the adults were “fully cooperative” with responding officers.
> 
> The four children, ages 5-10, were taken into custody by the Department of Children and Families after both police and fire filed 51A neglect forms, and remained there for at least a week, a DCF spokesperson previously confirmed.
> 
> It’s unclear what the third responding agency reported, as an EMS trip report provided to the Herald following a public records request, was almost entirely redacted, due to privacy and medical exemptions.

> Four children are in the custody of the Department of Children and Families after first responders rushed to a South Boston apartment last Saturday and found a person deceased on the floor from unknown causes, officials said Thursday.
> 
> In a one-sentence statement released Thursday by DCF spokeswoman Andrea Grossman, the child protection agency confirmed the children are now in its custody, but declined to disclose whether they are in foster care or whether DCF has had prior interactions with their families.
> 
> “The Department of Children and Families has taken custody of the children who live in the home,’' Grossman wrote. The agency declined further comment citing state and federal privacy laws.
> 
> Boston police on Thursday night posted a statement saying that the four children each had a parent present in the apartment at 381 Old Colony Ave.
> 
> Governor Maura Healey briefly discussed the status of the children, who were discovered by first responders, including Boston firefighters, inside the apartment in the Mary Ellen McCormack housing development in South Boston. The development is managed by the Boston Housing Authority.
> 
> “Just heartbreaking. A terrible situation,” Healey told WCVB-TV on Wednesday. “DCF has taken those children into its care and custody right now.”
> 
> First responders rushed to the apartment shortly after 11 a.m. Saturday to investigate reports of a person suffering a health issue, according to a Boston police report.
> 
> Firefighters from Ladder 18 along with Boston Emergency Medical Services were already in the apartment, trying to resuscitate the person woman lying on the floor of the unit, according to the police report.
> 
> “The victim’s friends/associates contacted police when they observed the victim not breathing,” police wrote in a report provided to the Globe.
> 
> Those rescue efforts were unsuccessful and she was declared dead at 11:41 a.m., police said. The Office of Chief Medical Examiner took custody of the body and no cause of death has been publicly stated yet.

> 
> Police did not summon homicide detectives to the scene of what is currently considered as sudden death. But other detectives did “respond to the residence to photograph the scene as part of the investigation,” police said in Thursday night’s statement.
> 
> The adults “were fully cooperative with the Boston Police Officers who responded,” the statement said.
> 
> The name of the deceased was redacted in the police report. However, the report indicated the 28-year-old woman did not live in the apartment.
> 
> According to police, parents and officers took steps to see protect the children from seeing the body. They “felt it was best for the children to stay in another room with one of the parents,” the statement said.
> 
> The Boston Housing Authority said in a statement it is cooperating with police investigators.
> 
> “The Boston Housing Authority is working closely with the Boston Police Department as they continue to investigate the circumstances around the recent death at Mary-Ellen McCormack. BHA received no complaints about activity in this unit prior to the incident, but we care deeply about the safety of all our residents and are working actively with the agencies involved to take all appropriate follow-up action. BHA has a strong partnership with BPD and communicates with them often. The only call BHA received this year about this unit was for a routine maintenance issue in May, which was responded to appropriately at that time.”
> 
> The first report filed by arriving police officers makes no mention of children being in the home last Saturday. However, on Sunday, police created a supplemental report and filed a 51A, a report of possible abuse or neglect, with the DCF “regarding conditions in the home.” DCF is required to investigate 51A allegations.
> 
> Boston City Councilor at Large Michael Flaherty said firefighters who responded on Saturday were appalled by the conditions inside the apartment and that they were deeply concerned about the healthy and safety of the children.
> 
> Firefighters told him there were four children and at least five adults in the apartment on Saturday, Flaherty said.
> 
> “They walk in and they see somewhat of an unsanitary and unsafe situation is how they described it,’' he said. “In general, it wasn’t good.”
> 
> The firefighters also filed 51A reports with the DCF, according to Flaherty.
> 
> In its statement, Boston police disputed the assertion that conditions were not safe.
> 
> “Information that drugs and other concerning materials were strewn about the home is not supported by what officers encountered or by the information received on scene,” the statement said.
> 
> In a statement, the Boston Housing Authority said there were no previous complaints or issues with the tenant in the unit. Citing state and federal privacy laws, the agency declined to provide any details on the number of people who lived there. The BHA said it is cooperating with the police investigation.
