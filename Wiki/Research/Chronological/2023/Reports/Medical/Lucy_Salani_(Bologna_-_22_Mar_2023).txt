> Early life[]
> Lucy Salani was born as Luciano Salani in Fossano, Piedmont, in 1924.[1][2][3] She then moved to Bologna with her family,[1][4] who had Emilian origins and raised her to anti-fascist values.[5][6] However, Salani was rejected by her father and brothers because of her homosexuality,[7][8] and had to keep her relationships with other men hidden in order to avoid persecution from the fascist regime.[3][5][9]
> 
> World War II and deportation in Dachau[]
> In August 1943, following the start of World War II, Salani was called up to the Italian army, as military service had been made mandatory for all young men.[1][6][10] After a failed desertion attempt, she was sent to serve in Cormons, Friuli Venezia Giulia.[10] However, she managed to defect the army shortly after the Armistice of Cassibile,[1] returning to Bologna and re-uniting with her parents, who had fled to Mirandola.[10] However, being in fear of putting her family in danger, Salani came out of desertion, being subsequently forced to join a group of the Nazi German army in Suviana, where she was assigned to the anti-aircraft warfare.[5][11] However, she successfully deserted once again: after throwing herself into icy water and contracting pneumonia as a result, she managed to run away from the hospital she had been brought to in Bologna.[1][11]

> Salani spent the following months living in the city as a prostitute, having even several German officers as clients.[11] However, during a meeting with one of the aforementioned officers in a hotel, the police broke into the building and arrested her after finding out about her desertion.[12] She was subsequently locked up in the cellar of a farmhouse near Padua, where she managed to escape from thanks to a broken lock, only to get caught again in Mirandola.[12] She was then incarcerated in Bologna and Modena, before being taken to Verona, as a criminal case was held against her.[12] Although Salani was originally sentenced to death, she successfully persuaded German general Albert Kesselring to concede her a pardon, being sent to a labor camp in Bernau, Germany, instead.[1][5][12] She managed to escape from the camp, as well,[1] together with another prisoner, who was later killed by German officers during their escape.[13] However, after reaching the border between Austria and Italy by train, Salani got caught once more.[1][13]

Some nights, I still dream of the most horrendous things I saw, and I feel like I'm still [trapped] there, and so, I want people to know what happened in the concentration camps, so that it won't happen again».[15][18]
