> The mother of a transgender woman murdered 21 years ago said she’s “thankful” her daughter’s killers are finally behind bars — but believes the case was never considered a priority because of her child’s sexual identity.
> 
> “It was because (she) was a transvestite,” Fanny White, 60, told the Daily News when asked why she thought it took so long for police to make arrests in her daughter Amanda’s murder. “I’ve grown and I’m at peace with a lot of things since the time it happened.”
> 
> Amanda White, 20, was found dead on E. 173rd St. and Boston Road on March 11, 1997. She had been strangled with an electrical cord and was found wrapped in a blanket with a bag covering her head.
> 
> Within the last two weeks, police arrested two men — Christopher (Champagne) Dickerson, 42, and Glenn Broadnax, 40 — in Amanda’s slaying.
> 
> DNA recovered from the murder weapon led police to the two men, although it wasn’t disclosed why they had targeted Amanda. The men had argued with Amanda before, but the case is not considered a hate crime, said police.
> 
> Broadnax — who was shot by police in 2013 when he was seen jumping in front of cars while talking to dead relatives and simulating a gun with his fingers — was arrested on murder charges Thursday and ordered held without bail. Dickerson was arrested for the killing on Aug. 15 and was also remanded to custody.
> 
> Fanny White said her child was born Warren, but came out as Amanda about two years before she died.
> 
> Her daughter was happy with her identity and was in a relationship when she was killed, Fanny White remembered.
> 
> “I trust in the Lord,” the heartbroken mom said. “The Lord promised me that before I die (my child) will have justice. I want to be able to share how thankful and grateful and appreciative I am of the police department.”
> 
> Amanda was never identified as transgender in police reports.
> 
> Court papers listed the victim as Warren White, and the initial police paperwork on the case, before White was identified, referred to White as a John Doe.
> 
> The murder investigation into her death quickly stalled and remained unsolved until 2013, when detectives took a fresh look at the case.
