> The unsolved murder of a computer analyst and transgender woman who was found dead in her Sydney home more than two decades ago will be examined by a gay hate crimes royal commission-style inquiry.
> 
> Three days before Christmas 1997, the body of Westpac Bank employee Samantha Rose was found by her kitchen table at her Kensington home in Sydney's east.
> 
> Ms Rose, who volunteered at community radio stations Sydney 2RPH and 2SER, identified as female and was undergoing hormone replacement therapy.
> 
> She was found lying on her back with a kitchen chair knocked over near her head, while her apartment was in a state of disarray.
> 
> She had major injuries consistent with having suffered "numerous heavy blows to the head with a blunt object", Senior Counsel Assisting the inquiry Peter Gray said during the commission's opening hearing.
> 
> This included a fractured skull and severe bruising.
> 
> Police found no evidence of forced entry, suggesting her killer was not a stranger.
> 
> Last seen on the afternoon of December 20, police believe she likely died that day or the next.
> 
> A 1999 inquest found Ms Rose died of head injuries, inflicted by an unknown person.
> 
> No one has ever been charged with her killing and the single person of interest has since died.
> 
> Strike Force Parrabell that was set up to analyse 88 cases in NSW for possible bias against members of the LGBTIQ community, recommended Ms Rose's killing remain unsolved.
> 
> The strike force also found there was "insufficient information to establish a bias crime".
> 
> The inquiry will hear evidence on Ms Rose's case when hearings continue in Sydney on Friday.
